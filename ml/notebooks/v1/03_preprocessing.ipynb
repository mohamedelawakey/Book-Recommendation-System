For many therapists, forming supervisory/integration groups provides a means of articulating countertransference issues which allows for self-exploration, investigation and understanding. Robbins presents transcriptions of some of these group supervision sessions, which emphasize the mixture of cognitive and affective organization which the therapist is continually exploring with the patient. He examines the issues that are raised in each session, highlighting the difficulty for the therapist of maintaining objective emotional distance from the patient while remaining receptive, and the complex issue of how much of the therapist's own personality should be permitted to emerge during the therapeutic relationship. A special chapter addresses teh complex countertransference issues that specifically apply to creative art therapy.\n",

It's the media, after all, that decide which court rulings to cover and how. They translate highly complex judgments into concise and meaningful news stories that will appeal to, and be understood by, the general public. Thus, judges lose control of the message once they hand down decisions, and journalists have the last word.<br /><br />To show how the Supreme Court has fared under the media spotlight, Sauvageau, Schneiderman, and Taras examine a year in the life of the court and then focus on the media coverage of four high-profile decisions: the Marshall case, about Aboriginal rights; the Vriend case, about gay rights; the Quebec Secession Reference; and the Sharpe child pornography case. They explore the differences between television and newspaper coverage, national and regional reporting, and the French- and English-language media. They also describe how judges and journalists understand and interact with one another amid often-clashing legal and journalistic cultures, offering a rich and detailed account of the relationship between two of the most important institutions in Canadian life.\n",

      "3   James Denney is now best known, though in increasingly restricted circles, for his book The Death of Christ, considered for over a century a lucid and standard exposition of objective atonement understood in substitutionary terms. However, there is breadth and depth to Denney's thought, a richness and passion in his theological work, an attractive integrity and spiritual immediacy in his writing, that resists any reducing of his legacy to that of being an apologist for one aspect of Christian doctrine. By exploring his early years growing up in Greenock, Scotland, following his intellectual development through university and college years in Glasgow, and considering the impact of a long pastoral ministry in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, a context is created for studying the mind, personality and faith that informed his mature theological writing. For twenty years, from 1897-1917, he taught biblical theology and exegesis in his denominational College in Glasgow, developing his theology through articulation, and then exploring and expounding the gospel of Christ as first and originally expressed in the apostolic experience and testimony embedded in the New Testament documents. The theological work of Denney, taken as a whole, was both intellectually engaged and ecclesially focused, as he sought to construct a secure basis for biblical faith. His theology was offered in the service of the church, his learning a self-conscious discipleship of the intellect. This is the major study of Denney to use the large corpus of Denney's unpublished theological papers and sermons held in New College Library, in the University of Edinburgh. These, together with Denney's published work, and wider biographical research, form the basis of this study, an intellectual and contextual biography of one of Scotland's most attractive and forceful theological personalities. \"\"James Gordon's study offers the first full-scale intellectual biography of Principal Denney. Informed by a deep knowledge of James Denney's writings (both published and unpublished), he offers an engaging treatment of his subject. In particular, the contextualising of Denney's work in the setting of late Victorian and Edwardian Christianity contributes to a unique appreciation of his life and theology.\"\" --David Fergusson, Head of the School of Divinity, New College University of Edinburgh \"\"It is the merit of this new book that it give an honest evaluation of the man that recognizes his worth without turning a blind eye to his complexity. Here is a clear and compelling account of a remarkable theologian whose theology was utterly christocentric and for whom 'not Bethlehem by Calvary' was 'the focus of revelation'.\"\" --I Howard Marshall, from the Foreword \"\"Jim Gordon's study of the theology of James Denney, the great Scottish theologian of the cross, is a first class piece of work. As well as showing a mastery of Denney's published works, Gordon has made excellent use of a mass of hitherto untapped manuscript material. 'The study is not a comprehensive systematic presentation of Denney's theology, but a biography of the mind which produced it.' It succeeds admirable in its intention.\"\" --D. Densil Morgan, Professor of Theology, University of Wales, Bangor \"\"Dr. Gordon brings to life for us this leader of Scottish liberal evangelicalism. He shows us a Christian thinker who. throughout his life, reshaped his articulation of the faith in response to the spiritual and intellectual challenges of his day and, above all, to make the faith communicable.\"\" --Andrew Ross, Honorary Fellow, New College, Edinburgh Jim Gordon is Principal of the Scottish Baptist College, at the University of Paisley.

His biography is certain to inform, engage, and challenge.\" --Thomas H. Appleton, Jr., editor of <em>The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</em><br /><br />\"This well written and meticulously documented biography is a case study of how regional heritage, family, and self can combine to restrict the talent and success of an individual. A hostage to the past, Sawitzky epitomizes the American 'every woman, ' who struggles, compromises, and survives.\" --Carol Crowe-Carraco, Western Kentucky University<br /><br />\"<em>Cautious Rebel, </em> based upon extensive research in the Susan Clay Sawitzky papers as well as other Clay family papers, will be a significant contribution to historical and literary scholarship and should have an appeal to historians and specialists in American literature--especially those with an interest in poetry.\" --Nancy Forderhase, Eastern Kentucky University<br /><br />Susan Clay Sawitzky (1897-1981) was born into a traditional Kentucky family dominated by the lingering renown of its patriarch and Susan's great-grandfather, Henry Clay. Family and community expected Susan to take her place on the pedestal of Southern womanhood, but Susan reached maturity at the height of the first women's movement and heard the promises of that movement. In the late 1920s she attempted to live independently, the startled everyone by eloping and moving to New York City with William Sawitzky, a divorced Russian emigr�.<br /><br />For sixty years Susan Clay Sawitzky struggled against the values assimilated in her youth, ideals shared by her Old World husband and American society in general. She wrote poignantly about confinement and freedom in the privacy of her study and published a small amount of poetry and art history. But she was not an exceptional woman; she could not take the risks necessary to achieve the degree of success she coveted. The detailed record she left reveals the forces, both subtle and complex, that compromised her dreams and accomplishments. Lindsey Apple employs nearly seventy years of Susan Clay Sawitzky's personal letters and poetry to reconstruct the world of a woman seeking modernity with \"the millstone of tradition\" upon her shoulders.<br /><br />Women's studies has been inclined, unintentionally, to create a new elite. Historians have preferred to emphasize progress, particularly when created by women themselves, and biographers have chosen strong, successful women. But the vast majority of women were not activists. Susan Clay Sawitzky's life shows that tradition and modernity can and did exist simultaneously, creating tremendous complexity in the lives of individuals. Her experiences suggest that compromise may result as much from fatigue as from lack of desire or courage.\n",

Among the 112 poems in <i>William Wilfred Campbell: Selected Poetry and Essays</i> are the familiar \"Indian Summer\" and \"How One Winter Came in the Lake Region,\" along with many less well-known love poems, patriotic songs, and occasional poems. Some twenty manuscript pieces are published here for the first time.<br /><br />The notorious \"Mermaid Inn\" essay in which Campbell refers to the mythical nature of the cross is included, and so is the letter of self-justification that Campbell wrote--but never sent--to the editor of the <i>Globe</i>. Here, too, are speeches, essays published in <i>The Week</i> and the <i>Ottawa Evening Journal</i>, and significant sections from Campbells unfinished treatise on evolution, \"The Tragedy of Man.\"<br /><br />By the time Campbell died on New Year's Day 1918, shifting values had begun to turn critical opinion against his work.

Dirac, who died in 1984, was unquestionably one of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century. The book describes his human side, with many anecdotes about the man with a reputation for silence. His immense influence on modern physics is surveyed in chapters written by eminent scientists. Dirac was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1933 at the age of thiry-one. His tremendous contributions to the field included his prediction of the magnetic moment and antiparticles as well as the spin of the electron. His formulations of the quantum field theory, statistics of particles and fields, his work on gravitational waves, and his prediction of magnetic monopoles stand as monuments to his originality and deep understanding of natural phenomena. This book will appeal to anyone interested in the development of quantum theory or in Paul Dirac.\n",

Aimed at historians of mathematics, philosophy, ethics and logic, this volume contains the first English translations of some of his most significant mathematical writings, which contain the details of many celebrated insights and anticipations: clear topological definitions of various geometric extensions, an effective statement and use of the Cauchy convergence before it appears in Cauchy's work, remarkable results on measurable numbers (a version of real numbers), on functions (the construction of a continuous, non-differentiable function around 1830) and on infinite collections.\n",

She is most interested in self-help books directed primarily toward women. These books offer advice about managing relationships, enhancing sexuality, developing self-esteem, becoming assertive, and improving our spiritual lives. Simonds looks at hundreds of books, including such well-known ones as Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique, Robin Norwood's Women Who Love Too Much, Harold Kushner's When Bad Things Happen to Good People, and Alexander Comfort's The Joy of Sex. Even though many critics see these books as anti-feminist drivel, their continued success says something about American women's search for meaning. Simonds examines the social construction, cultural consumption, and transmission of ideas about gender and the self. She wants to know why such books are appealing and what their readers are doing with them.  <br /><br /><br />Readers' own responses to self-help books, though varied, do fall into patterns. A few readers reject the messages found in these books but most affirm the content. They look for validation of how they already feel and for answers to their problems. Traditionally women care for others; reading self-help books gives them a chance to nurture themselves.   <br /><br />Simonds explores the cultural messages offered by self-help books. What do the books preach about blame, feminism, and individualism?  She looks at sex manuals which advise their readers not only to learn techniques but also to improve their self-identities. She looks at self-help books that deal with the larger arena of relationships between men and women. Authors see such relationships as plagued by nearly insurmountable problems. Men are obstacles that women must work around as they attempt to forge meaningful relationships in what is characterized as a war zone.<br /><br /><br />Simonds discusses the place of self-help books in relation to other forms of culture.  She views self-help books as an example of the didacticism that pervades women's experiences. In her words, \"self-help culture is our culture.\"  The same therapeutic culture that characterizes self-help books can also be found in magazines, soap operas, and talk shows. These books are buyable therapy. In a sense, self-help books commodify readers by urging them to make themselves into objects of analysis and improvement. Such books try to give their readers an understanding of existing problems, but they also help create the problems.<br /><br /><br />Are self-help books politically conservative or liberating?  There is no easy answer. The authors of self-help books seek answers through individual change, not social change.  They reinforce the traditional dependence of women on authority. But at the same time Simonds argues that self-help books can validate caring, and serve as a form of women caring for women. These books shift the emphasis of caring, as they encourage their readers to care less about their involvements with others and more about their own personal development, but for the ultimate goal of achieving better connections with others. <br />\n",

Yet for Linux to be adopted by the mainstream of Unix-based corporate and ISP networks, it must be capable of supporting the TCP/IP Internet protocol, like any other network operating system. This book provides the rapidly growing audience of Linux site managers, as well as researchers and developers worldwide, with the information they need on how Linux TCP/IP keeps the network running. Internationally recognized expert on Internetworking, Jon Crowcroft walks readers through the Linux TCP/IP protocol stack, offering detailed explanations on how Linux implements its communications protocols. Vinton Cerf--co-inventor of TCP/IP--is the technical editor for this book.\n",

James and Patrick J. Daley's <i>Cultural Politics and the Mass Media</i> elegantly reveals how newspapers, radio stations and television programs became strategic sites of Native resistance to the economic and cultural agendas of non-Native settlers. <br />  <br /> Through these empirically-grounded studies, the authors demonstrate that freedom for indigenous peoples is not only premised on control over their political economy, but also on their capacity to tell their own stories. In so doing, they develop a powerful, historically grounded argument for understanding cultural persistence as a valuable and vital form of self-determination.<br />\n",

The author's thesis is stated in his first chapter: \"Time was when the American labor movement was respected as a force for social justice. Certainly this view was widely held in early CIO days. Today, however, even liberals regard unions as bureaucratized self-interest establishments. . . . But I know this is not the end of the process . . . .\"<br /><br />Leaving Pittsburgh at the age of fourteen, when his father was laid off, Marquart was drawn to Detroit by Henry Ford's revolutionary five dollars a day wage--and landed in a metal shop at ten cents an hour. At the age of seventeen, through an English fellow worker, he learned about unionism and the Labor Party, became a Young Socialist, and experienced the Palmer Raids. He also joined the Auto Workers Union, which the AFL suspended in 1917 for organizing on industrial rather than craft lines.<br /><br />After being laid off in 1930, Marquart spend six years as a \"freelance soap boxer,\" hobo, broom salesman, patient in a TB sanitorium, and WPA Workers Education staffer, becoming education director of the UAW Dodge Local in 1937. After experiencing the Dodge sit-down strike, he moved to the Ford local, where he was ousted by the Stalinist faction. He then moved to the most militant GM local, where he taught part-time for the University of Michigan Labor and Industrial Relations Institute, before his final assignment with the UAW International headquarters. Since retiring he has written labor criticism for <em>Dissent, The New Leader</em>, and <em>The New Republic</em>, and has recorded his experience for the oral history project of Wayne State University's Labor Archives.<br /><br />Drawing upon his own observations, the testimony of rank-and-file unionists, and recent labor history, the author concludes that \"today, for all the UAW's liberalism . . . the assembly lines remain plodding, monotonous, pace-driving treadmills.\"\n",

They are considered the most primitive representatives of the group of craniate chordates, which - apart from the hagfishes that show no traces of verte brae -includes all vertebrate animals. Consequently the hagfishes have played and still playa central role in discussions concerning the evolution of the vertebrates. Although most of the focus on hagfishes may be the result of their being primitive, it should not be forgotten that, at the same time, they are specialized animals with a unique way of life that is interesting in its own right. It is now more than 30 years since a comprehensive treatise on hagfishes was published. The Biology of Myxine, edited by Alf Brodal and Ragnar Fange (Universitetsforlaget, Oslo, 1963), provided a wealth of information on the biology of hagfishes, and over the years remained a major source of information and inspiration to students of hagfishes.\"\n",

The book includes eleven expanded appendices--with statistics, model pleadings, and other illustrations--and will prove an invaluable source for information on the courts, their procedures, and their case-loads. The approach throughout the volume is comparative, with many references to developments in UK common law and in the EC institutions.\n",

M. BAYLISS and E. H. STARLING at the inception of the twentieth century, intense interest has focused on numerous, continually expanding classes of small peptides which appear to serve as regulatory molecules in the gastrointestinal tract, brain, and other organ systems. Initially, many of these substances were, like secretin, discovered in functional assays as \"factors\" or \"activities\" extractable in minute quantities from tissues or tissue fluids. By the middle of the century, advances in biochemical and immunological methods for the purification, characterization, and quantification of biologically active peptides in organ systems, tissues, and body fluids provided further impetus to this field. It was readily appreciated that small, biologically active peptides were particularly abundant in the digestive tract. Many peptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin, and more recently peptide YY and galanin were in fact originally discovered in and isolated from gut tissue. Moreover, these peptides were found to have profound actions on the gastroenteropancreatic system in vivo and in vitro. During the past 2 decades, information on regulatory peptides has burgeoned as a result of technological refinements in the synthesis of peptides, improved methods for detecting and visualizing peptides and their precursors in cells and tissues from a variety of species, advances in the functional assessment of peptide activity, and the application of molecular biological techniques to the char acterization of peptide gene structure and expression.\"\n",

Soft Computing (SC) consists of several computing paradigms, including fuzzy logic, n- ral networks, and genetic algorithms, which can be used to produce powerful hybrid intelligent systems for solving problems in pattern recognition, time series prediction, intelligent control, robotics and automation. Hybrid intelligent systems that combine several SC techniques are needed due to the complexity and high dimensionality of real-world problems. Hybrid intelligent systems can have different architectures, which have an impact on the efficiency and accuracy of these systems, for this reason it is very important to optimize architecture design. The architectures can combine, in different ways, neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms, to achieve the ultimate goal of pattern recognition, time series prediction, intelligent control, or other application areas. This book is intended to be a major reference for scientists and engineers interested in applying new computational and mathematical tools to design hybrid intelligent systems. This book can also be used as a reference for graduate courses like the f- lowing: soft computing, intelligent pattern recognition, computer vision, applied ar- ficial intelligence, and similar ones. The book is divided in to twelve main parts. Each part contains a set of papers on a common subject, so that the reader can find similar papers grouped together.\n"

The aim of this book is to demonstrate that a clear, more precise response to the question of performance accountability is possible through the systematic application of evaluation methods to document value. <br /> The authors begin with a review of the legislative history of fiscal accountability beginning with the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, and ending with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. A discussion of existing applicable economic models, methods, and associated metrics follows. The book concludes with evaluation case studies.\n",
      "305728                       Constructing Floridians: Natives and Europeans in the Colonial Floridas, 1513-1783  <i>Constructing Floridians</i> explores the origins of racialization in peninsular Florida and its hinterlands during the 300 years prior to the founding of the United States. Focusing not on a single ethnic or cultural community but on all the major groups in the region during the colonial period, this sociocultural study of Europeans and native tribes examines the processes by which the peoples of Spain, France, and Great Britain and half a dozen Florida tribes—the Gulaes, Calusas, Timucuans, Apalachees, Creeks, and Seminoles—forged understandings of one another and themselves through their individual and collective ideas and activities. Murphree argues that the Europeans, frustrated by their inability to “tame” the peninsula, blamed the natives for their problems. Emphasizing how environmental limitations and repeated colonial failures contributed to increasingly negative perceptions and characterizations of American Indians—which the Europeans attributed to perceived racial differences—he contends that barriers between the Europeans and the Indians hardened over time.<br />            Surveying the evolution of relationships from the era of early Spanish exploration to the American Revolution, this work offers new perspectives through which to view European conceptual-izations of Indians, illuminates specific native roles in molding a backcountry society, and reconsiders overall North American population interaction during the period. The story of Florida’s past through a perspective rarely applied to the peninsula or its borderlands should appeal to audiences interested in Florida’s colonial development, Native Americans in the region, or issues of race and identity in early modern history.\n",

This book dispels that myth by providing a logical, non-denominational summary flowing from creation, to the fall of mankind, to the redemption we have in Jesus Christ, and finally to death and resurrection. It provides reasonable answers to such age-old questions as: How old is the earth? Where are the dinosaurs in the Bible? What was the original sin and its consequences? Where did Cain get his wife? The difference between misunderstood concepts like the soul and spirit and the body and the bride. What is baptism? Who is Jesus? How did he fulfill prophecy? What does it mean to be born-again? And where do we go when we die? A must-read for anyone struggling with these questions and how these concepts tie together.\n",

It discusses current sports-related controversies and includes new material comparing the sociology and psychology of distinguishing the two related disciplines.

The sun was barely a stain in the sky, but the air was hot and clammy. My nightgown stuck to my skin. I padded to the bathroom and splashed my face with cold water. My stomach clenched in a queasy ball . . . I'd keep myself out of trouble in Jericho, I promised myself. I'd do all the right things and make lots of good friends and no one would care a whit about my being a preacher's daughter.\"</i><br /><br />Jo Clawson isn't the boy her father wanted, and she's not the \"young lady\" her neighbors expect of the preacher's daughter, either. But even though Jo doesn't always meet the expectations of the people around her, she still longs to fit in. When she and her family leave their northern home for the small southern town of Jericho, Alabama, Jo might finally stop picking fights and settle in right.<br /><br />But when Jo befriends a young black boy, she discovers that \"fitting in\" is about a lot more than proper manners or a smart outfit. Suddenly she's faced with a new set of questions that call up her own values. Maybe some fights are worth picking, after all.<br /><br />Set in 1957, this unforgettable novel tells the inspiring story of a young girl growing up amid racism.<br />\n",

Founded in 1959 with the purpose of disseminating the most recently developed scientific information to groups in industry, government, high schools, and universities, REA has since become a successful and highly respected publisher of study aids, test preps, handbooks, and reference works.REA's Test Preparation series includes study guides for all academic levels in almost all disciplines. Research &amp; Education Association publishes test preps for students who have not yet completed high school, as well as high school students preparing to enter college. Students from countries around the world seeking to attend college in the United States will find the assistance they need in REA's publications. For college students seeking advanced degrees,REA publishes test preps for many major graduate school admission examinations in a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, law, and medicine. Students at every level, in every field, with every ambition can find what they are looking for among REA's publications.While most test preparation books present practice tests that bear little resemblance to the actual exams, REA's series presents tests that accurately depict the official exams in both degree of difficulty and types of questions. REA's practice tests are always based upon the most recently administered exams, and include every type of question that can be expected on the actual exams.REA's publications and educational materials are highly regarded and continually receive an unprecedented amount of praise from professionals, instructors, librarians, parents, and students. Our authors are as diverse as the fields represented in the books we publish. They are well-known in their respective disciplines and serve on the faculties of prestigious high schools, colleges, and universities throughout the United States and Canada.Chapter 1: INTRODUCTIONABOUT THIS BOOKThis book provides you with an accurate and complete representation of the Tests of General Educational Development (GED). REA's three full-length practice tests are based on the latest editions of the GED tests, which were overhauled for 2002. Our topical reviews and drills are designed to prepare you for the very kind of material you will see when taking the actual test. You are allowed 7 hours and 5 minutes to complete each of our sample tests. That's the same amount of time you will be given during the actual exam. (Don't panic! The actual exam is usually administered during two or three sittings over a period of two days. Check with your state's department of education for information on GED test centers, test times, and test dates.) Our sample tests have been carefully calibrated to match the GED's level of difficulty, format, and content. Following each model test you will find an answer key along with detailed explanations designed to help you master the material and score high.ABOUT THE TESTWho takes the test and what is it used for?The GED is taken by people who did not complete their high school education and would like to obtain a state-issued high school diploma. The diploma is awarded upon successful completion of the five GED tests. Candidates may choose to take the GED to fulfill requirements for admission to colleges or other schools, to further their careers, or even just for the sake of self-satisfaction. The GED is taken by nearly 800,000 people every year.Who administers the test?The GED is developed and administered by the GED Testing Service of the American Council on Education (ACE). Questions for the GED are created by writers and reviewers who are experienced in secondary or adult education. They follow standardized procedures, developed by the GED Testing Service, to ensure that the content and difficulty levels are appropriate. According to the American Council on Education, the writers and reviewers represent a wide variety of ethnic groups and are selected from many geographic areas. All questions are reviewed by a number of people, revised as necessary, and then are standardized based on a nationally selected sample of graduating high school seniors.When and where is the test given?The GED is administered on a regular basis in the United States and Canada. To accommodate all candidates, there are many versions of the exam, including administrations in English, French, Spanish, Braille, large print, and on audiotape.To receive information on upcoming administrations of the GED, contact your local high school, adult school, GED Testing Center, or the GED Testing Service at:1-800-62 MY GED (1-800-626-9433) orGeneral Educational DevelopmentGED Testing ServiceAmerican Council on EducationOne Dupont Circle, N.W.Washington, DC 20036Website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.gedtest.orgHOW\">http://www.gedtest.orgHOW</a> TO USE THIS BOOKWhat do I study first?Before you do anything else, take Practice Exam I to help you determine what areas may cause you the most difficulty. After you are done with the first practice exam, go through and check your answers against the answer keys found at the end of the practice test. It is also suggested that you read through the detailed explanations of answers found at the end of each practice test, as this will help you to understand what you are doing wrong. Once you have taken a practice test, you should first study the reviews which cover your problem areas. The reviews will cover the information you will need to know when taking the exam.When you have done this, you should go back and study all of the remaining reviews and the test-taking tips which appear at the end of this introduction. Make sure you take the review drills that are interspersed within each review. Both the reviews and the drills will be very useful in helping you brush up on your skills. It will be also be beneficial to read through the Appendix, which includes the Periodic Table, a math reference table, the Constitution of the United States, and the Declaration of Independence.After studying REA's review, take Practice Exam II and Practice Exam III. When you take our GED practice tests, be sure to do your best to simulate testing conditions: sit at a table in a room free of distractions and time yourself. Doing this will make you less nervous on the day of the actual test and, more importantly, you will develop a sense of pacing. After timing yourself for all of the practice tests, you will have a very good idea of how much time you can spend on each question during the actual GED.When should I start studying?It is never too early for you to start studying for the GED - the earlier the better. You should start studying as soon as possible so that you will be able to learn more. Starting early will allow you the time necessary to strengthen your problem areas. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the exam material.FORMAT OF THE GEDAll of the questions in the GED (except for the essay in the Writing test and several alternate format questions in the Mathematics test), will be in multiple-choice format. Each question will have five answers, numbered one through five, from which to choose. You should be aware of the amount of time you have to complete each section of the test, so that you do not waste too much time working on difficult questions, while neglecting to answer easy questions. Speed is very important. Using the practice tests will help you prepare for this task. Taking as many of the practice tests as possible, and making sure to time yourself, will help you become accustomed to the time constraints. Repeating this process will help you develop speed in answering the questions because you will become more familiar with the format.The GED at a GlanceTEST 1 - Language Arts: Writing &gt; Part I / 50 questions / 75 minutes / Deals with sentence structure, usage, mechanics, and organization&gt; Part II / One essay / 45 minutes / An essay of about 250 wordsTEST 2 - Social Studies &gt; 50 questions / 70 minutes / History, geography, economics, and political scienceTEST 3 - Science &gt; 50 questions / 80 minutes / Life science (biology), physical science (chemistry and physics), and Earth and space scienceTEST 4 - Language Arts: Reading&gt; 40 questions / 65 minutes / Literary fiction and nonfiction proseTEST 5 - Mathematics: Arithmetic (measurement, number relationships, and data analysis), Algebra, and Geometry&gt; Part 1 / 25 questions / 45 minutes / Allows the use of a calculator&gt; Part 2 / 25 questions / 45 minutes / Does not allow the use of a calculatorTOTAL TESTING TIME: 7 hours, 5 minutes Test 1: Language Arts: Writing (Two Parts)Part I of the Writing Skills test consists of 50 multiple-choice items, which will require you to read passages and then answer a series of questions that follow.

The Mathematics test is divided into two parts. Part 1 (Item Nos. 1-25) allows calculator use. Part 2 (Item Nos. 26-50) does not allow the use of a calculator.Part 1 only allows the use of a specific calculator, the Casio fx-260 Solar Calculator. Although you may find it helpful to use the Casio fx-260 while taking our Mathematics practice test, you needn't buy one. This calculator will be provided at the testing center. You will be given a brief overview of the calculator and time to practice on it before the Mathematics test begins. For more information about the Casio fx-260 Solar Calculator, contact the American Council on Education.The Mathematics test has both multiple-choice questions and alternate-format questions. Unlike GED multiple-choice questions, which provide five possible answers for you to choose from, alternate-format questions require you to come up with your own answer. A total of 10 alternate-format questions are featured on the entire Mathematics test: You'll find seven in Part 1 and three in Part 2. One of these alternate-format questions will take the form of a coordinate plane. You'll have to grid in the correct answer on your answer sheet.ABOUT THE REVIEW SECTIONOur reviews are written to help you understand the concepts behind the questions which will be asked on the actual GED. They will help you to prepare for the actual test by teaching you what you need to know. Each review is complete with drills which will help to reinforce the subject matter.

Studying these rules will help you do well on both parts of the Writing Skills test. Also discussed in this review are essay writing techniques to aid you in developing a strong, well-organized essay for Part II of the Writing Skills test.Social Studies Test ReviewThis review provides a rundown of what you will need to know to pass the Social Studies test. Included are reviews of history, economics, political science, and geography. Drills are also provided to help you enhance your skills to pass this test. Our review will familiarize you with Social Studies and help you to become accustomed to reading Social Studies documents and answering questions concerning such documents. It is important to remember that the GED Social Studies test does not require you to memorize the large volume of information that is covered on the test. The test questions will be based on information documents, tables, graphs, or charts provided within the test. Science Test ReviewDiscussed in this review is everything you need to know to pass the Science test. Our review goes over the basics of biology (including cell biology, anatomy, ecology, and genetics), physics, space science, Earth science, and chemistry. Included are drills on biology, earth science, space science, physics, and chemistry. Like the Social Studies test, the Science test does not require you to memorize all of science. The questions are based on information documents, tables, or graphs.Language Arts: Reading Test ReviewThis review will help you become familiar with the type of material that you will encounter on the actual GED. The extensive reviews and drills cover writing forms including fiction and nonfiction prose, poetry, drama, essay, and commentary. Studying the Language Arts: Reading Review will help you do well on this test.Mathematics Test ReviewThe Math test review covers the basics of what you need to know to pass this test from arithmetic all the way to geometry. Our reviews will take you through problems step-by-step and will show you how to use important mathematical equations in certain math problems. At the end of each section, there are valuable drills which will help you to thoroughly familiarize yourself with the math concepts that will appear on the Mathematics test.SCORING THE EXAMHow is the GED scored?When you receive your GED score report from ACE, it will contain six scores. Five individual scores will be reported, one for Parts I and II of the Language Arts: Writing test, one for the Social Studies test, one for the Science test, one for the Language Arts: Reading test, and one for the Mathematics test. The sixth score listed on the score report will be an average of the five individual test scores.During the scoring process, an individual test is first given a raw score, which is your total number of correct answers. The raw score is then converted into a standard score, which ranges from a low of 20 to a high of 80. The standard score is what appears on your score report. Since each test has a different number of questions, raw scores must be converted into standard scores so that your performance on each of the individual tests may be accurately compared. Since various forms of the GED are administered during any one examination, the use of standard scores also corrects for changes in difficulty level between the different forms of the test. In other words, your score should be about the same no matter what form of the test you are given.Most states require a minimum standard score of 40 on each individual test and a minimum average score of 45 for all 5 tests. To achieve a standard score of 45 on any one of the individual tests, you must answer at least 50% of the test questions correctly.How is my score obtained for the Writing test?In order to obtain your score for the Writing Skills test, your raw score for both Parts are combined to form one raw score. Then, the raw score is converted into a standard score to give you a single, composite score for this test. Generally, the multiple-choice section of the Writing test is weighed more heavily than the essay. The composite score will consist of 60 to 65 percent of the multiple choice section and 35 to 40 percent of the essay.Scoring your essay will require you to use the same technique used by the actual essay readers. A holistic method will be used to score your essay, in which two trained readers will read your paper and each assign it a score. The readers will judge your essay on its overall effectiveness and proper use of the rules of English, although they will not be keeping track of each and every mistake. Their overall impression of the essay will be the basis for your score.Each essay will be graded using a four-point scale, with a score of four (4) being the highest and a score of one (1) being the lowest. The table below outlines what a GED essay reader will consider to be elements characterizing an essay at each score level.GED Essay ScoresScore of 4 - An essay with a score of four will address the question with a strong main idea (thesis) and will continue to address the question throughout the essay. An essay with a score of a 4 will not drift in its focus. This essay will also be extremely well organized. It will be concise and easy to understand. The topic will be effectively supported with examples that illustrate the point of the essay. Very few errors in the use of Standard Written English will be noted. Word choice will be varied, clear, and appropriate.Score of 3 - An essay with a score of three will be thoughtfully organized and present adequate support for the main idea. Some errors in the use of standard written English will appear, however, they will not be consistent.Score of 2 - An essay with a score of two will be underdeveloped and not extensively organized, although the essay will show some signs of planning and organization. The ideas used to support the main idea will often be weak and repetitive. There will be many errors in the use of standard written English.Score of 1 - An essay with a score of one will have virtually no structure and the numerous errors in the use of standard written English will make the essay difficult to understand. The essay will not be developed and will have no apparent purpose.Once each reader has assigned the essay a score, the two scores are added together, provided they do not differ by more than one point. A score between 2 and 8 will be obtained. This is your raw score.In some cases, one reader will assign an essay a low score, while the other reader will assign the same essay a high score. When such discrepancies occur with the two scores differing by more than one point, a third reader is called in to score the essay. The three scores are averaged (to do this, add the three scores together and divide by 3), then the average is doubled and rounded off to the nearest whole number. In such a case, this number would be your raw score.You may want to find two or three people who are willing to score your essay so you can obtain an objective raw score using the process described above. Should you decide to grade your own essay, assign the essay a score, using the chart, then double that number to determine the raw score. If you feel that your essay is between two scores (perhaps it is between a 3 and a 4 essay), add both numbers together to obtain your raw score (3 + 4 = 7) and divide by two. After determining your essay's score, record the score in the Scoring Worksheet.If you score your own essay, be objective! Most of us like to think that our work is excellent, but we must learn to see where there is room for improvement. On the other hand, some people have a tendency to automatically decide that their work is poor, when it may not be at all. Try to see your writing for what it is whether it is excellent, below average, or average.Remember, you want to be able to answer at least 50% of the questions in each test correctly so that you can ensure yourself a passing score.What is a passing score for the GED?Every state has its own requirements for what constitutes a passing score for the GED. Generally, each state will require that you obtain a certain score for each of the individual subject tests, and then also obtain a certain average (total) score, which is a combination of all of your individual scores.Listed on the following pages are the current GED requirements for each of the fifty states, U.S. territories, and Canada. Also included are age and residency requirements, testing fee amounts, and the title of the certificate which you will be awarded. For further information, you should contact your state's department of education. Studying for the GEDIt is important for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some students may set aside a certain number of hours every morning to study, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other students may study during the day, while waiting in a line, or they may even study while eating lunch. Only you will be able to determine when and where your studying is most effective. The most important factor to keep in mind is consistency. Use your time wisely. Work out a study routine - and stick to it!When you take the practice tests, try to make your practice conditions similar to actual testing conditions. Make sure you turn the television and radio off. Sit down at a quiet table which is free from distraction and time yourself! Afterwards, you should check each answer and thoroughly review the reasoning behind each question that you missed. You should not review too much at one time. Concentrate on each of your problem areas individually, until you feel comfortable with your ability in each of those areas.Do not write in the margins and spaces of this book when practicing, since you will not be allowed to write in the test booklet when taking the actual test. Also, make sure you do not write anything on your answer sheet, except to mark the answer you choose. Make sure the question numbers correctly correspond to the question numbers on the answer sheet.Keep track of your scores! You will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. You should carefully study the reviews that cover the areas which are causing you difficulty. This will help you build your skills in those areas.GED Test-Taking TipsYou may be unfamiliar with standardized tests, such as the GED. There are many ways for you to familiarize yourself with this type of examination. Listed below are points to help you become familiar with the GED, some of which may be applied to other standardized tests, as well.How to Beat the ClockBecome comfortable with the standardized format. When you are practicing to take the GED, pretend that you are under the same time constraints as you would be during the test. Stay calm, pace yourself, and pay attention to the clock. Practice these techniques thoroughly. After simulating the test only a few times, you will boost your chances of doing well and you will be able to sit down for the actual GED much more confidently.Become familiar with the directions. Make sure you read and understand the directions before you take the exam, so that you do not waste valuable testing time.Know the format for each section before you actually take the test. This will not only save you valuable time, but also ensure that you are familiar enough with the exam to avoid anxiety (and the mistakes that come from being anxious). Be sure to see details on the GED format elsewhere in this introduction.Work on the easier questions first. Mark the very difficult questions (in the test booklet, not on the answer sheet) and continue. Remember, only correct answers will be counted in your score. You will not be penalized for guessing, so when you have either answered or marked all of the questions, go back and answer any of the difficult questions that you may have skipped. If you find yourself working too long on one question, mark it and go on. Be sure that you are marking your answer in the space that corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet.Know how much time is allowed for each section. Remember that you are racing against the clock. This is why you should not spend too much time on a single question. Budget your time. Every question has the same value, whether it is difficult or easy, so it is important to move on if a question becomes too time consuming. Pace yourself and make sure to check your time periodically to make sure that you are progressing at a swift, steady rate.Should I guess?If you don't know the answer to a question, guess! Eliminate answers that you know are wrong, and then pick the best answer from the ones that remain. Even if you can't eliminate any answers, guess anyway! Remember that there is no penalty for guessing, and only correct answers are counted. This means that you should never leave an answer choice blank. If you guess correctly, you will increase your number of correct answers, and if you guess wrong, you will not lose any points.The Day of the TestOn the day of the test, you should wake up early (hopefully after a decent night's rest) and have a good breakfast. Make sure you dress comfortably, so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the exam. You should plan on arriving at the test center early. By being early, you will spare yourself the anxiety of being late for the test. It will also allow you to collect your thoughts and to relax before taking the exam.Before you leave for the test center, make sure that you have two forms of identification. You will not be admitted to the test center without identification. Acceptable forms of identification include a driver's license, Social Security card, birth certificate, passport, and green card.Make sure you bring at least two sharpened No. 2 pencils, with erasers, to the exam. You may want to wear a watch to the test center; however, only ordinary watches will be permitted. Watches with alarms, calculator functions, flashing lights, beeping sounds, etc., will not be allowed. In addition, neither food nor calculators will be allowed into the examination room.During the TestWhen you arrive at the test center, try to sit in a seat where you feel you will be comfortable. The GED is usually administered during two or three sittings, depending on your test center. No breaks are given during the exam. If you need to use the rest room, or if you become ill, you may leave the examination room, but you will not be allowed to make up any lost time.Once you enter the test center, follow all of the rules and instructions given by the test supervisor. If you do not, you risk being dismissed from the examination or having your GED scores voided (they will not be scored).When all of the test materials have been passed out, the test instructor will give you directions for filling out your answer sheet. You must fill out this sheet carefully since this information will be printed on your score report. Fill out your name exactly as it appears on your identification documents and admission ticket, unless otherwise instructed.Make sure you do not write in your test booklet or on your answer sheet, except to fill in the circle corresponding to the answer you choose. Scratch paper will be provided. You will be marking your answers on side two of your answer sheet. Each numbered row will contain five circles corresponding to each answer choice for that question. Fill in the circle which corresponds to your answer darkly, completely, and in a neat manner. You can change your answer, but remember to completely erase your old answer. Only one answer should be marked. This is very important, as your answer sheet will be machine scored, and stray lines or unnecessary marks may cause the machine to score your answers incorrectly.Only work on the test section on which the test instructor has instructed you to work. You should begin only when instructed to do so, and stop, immediately, when instructed to stop. Do not turn to the next section of the test until you are told to do so. When all of the sections have been completed, you should remain seated until all of the test materials have been collected.Good Luck on the GED!     33737\n",

A dozen candelabra tossed shadows around him, making him look taller than his six feet. In his hand was a gilded scroll, which he declined to read until the most dramatic moment. His ebony hair writhed around his shoulders as he moved with practiced grace before the hundred gathered eyes, and his voice filled the chamber. The crowd was silent as he spoke, their gazes alternating between his compelling countenance and the man on the dais. Dakel pointed an accusing finger at the man as he spoke.<br /><br />“I have charges, citizens of Nar,” he declared. “Appalling evidence of the duke’s crimes.” He held up the scroll for effect. “Enough to shock you good people, I’m sure.”<br /><br />From his chair atop the marble dais, Duke Angoris of Dragon’s Beak stared in horror at the Inquisitor, his face a sickly white. He had already endured half an hour of Dakel’s rhetoric, and the barrage was taking its toll. He licked his lips constantly, anxious for a glass of water that was conspicuously kept from him. He looked about to faint.<br /><br />“Now, I’m not a man of vendettas,” the Inquisitor declared. “You all know me. I’m a humble servant of the emperor. All I seek is justice.”<br /><br />There was skeptical chuckling from the crowd. Dakel took it good-naturedly.<br /><br />“’Tis true,” he said. “Justice is the sole commandment of this court. So I don’t read these charges with any relish or malice. I read them with great regret for the duke’s offenses. Through thethings he has done, we are all diminished.”<br /><br />An expectant murmur bubbled up. Dakel let it dissipate before continuing. He whirled on the duke.<br /><br />“Duke Angoris, you are called before these good people of Nar for crimes against humankind, for sedition, for treason, for barbarity, and for genocide. These are the facts in my ledger. Shall I read them for you?”<br /><br />Duke Angoris began to croak an answer but the Inquisitor silenced him with a flourish of his sleeves.<br /><br />“People,” he said, turning again toward the crowd. “Worthy citizens.” He smiled. “Friends. When you hear the charges against Duke Angoris, you will have no doubt as to the rightness of this tribunal. I know there are those among you who doubt what we do here. Do not doubt. Listen. And keep your ears open for the most appalling tales.”<br /><br />Angoris grit his teeth. He had no barrister to defend him, only his own wits and the infrequent opportunities Dakel gave him to speak. The Inquisitor glided closer to the dais and unrolled the scroll in his spidery hands. He read it to himself, shaking his head in disgust.<br /><br />“Duke Angoris,” he began. “On the first day of winter you usurped the throne of the south fork of Dragon’s Beak. You killed the surviving members of Duke Enli’s household and took control from the ruling magistrate, who had been sent there by our own emperor. Is that so?”<br /><br />“The throne was empty,” Angoris said. “The emperor’s to blame for that.”<br /><br />“And in your killing spree the magistrate and his wife were murdered also, correct?”<br /><br />Angoris was silent.<br /><br />“You impaled them, did you not?”<br /><br />The duke groped for an answer. Every word in Dakel’s ledger was true, but admitting it came hard. Angoris was a stubborn man, with a head like granite and a fiery streak of independence. He had declared himself duke of the south fork of Dragon’s Beak after the death of Enli, the rightful duke. Then he had set out for the ruined north fork.<br /><br />“Answer the question,” rumbled Dakel. “Did you not order the magistrate and his wife impaled?”<br /><br />The duke answered, “I did.”<br /><br />“And upon murdering the magistrate and taking Grey Tower, you found an unused cannister of poison in the keep. The illegal gas called Formula B, isn’t that also correct?”<br /><br />The Inquisitor hovered over the duke, waiting for an answer. Duke Angoris shifted, his eyes darting around the vast chamber.<br /><br />“No answer?” Dakel’s immortally blue eyes watched his victim like a cobra’s. “The poison, Duke? Have you a recollection?”<br /><br />“I ... I found the poison in the castle, yes. It was left there by legionnaires of the Black City. I didn’t put it there.”<br /><br />“And what did you do with the poison once you discovered it?”<br /><br />“I’ll not answer that,” spat Angoris. “Not to this court, and not to you. You have already judged me.”<br /><br />Dakel the Inquisitor, the very soul of the Protectorate, grinned wildly at the duke. “That’s fine, Duke Angoris. I’ll tell the story myself.” He turned like an actor toward the spectators in the candlelight. They were citizens of Nar who had come to the Tower of Truth for a show, and the master of the house would not disappoint them.<br /><br />“Good Narens,” he sang. “Let me tell you what this self-proclaimed duke has done. He has used the grievous and criminal poison called Formula B against the people of the north fork of Dragon’s Beak. These are people just like himself, you see, but Angoris is a man of boundless prejudice, and he is from the south fork, after all. This tyrant thinks of his northern brethren as beasts. He has systematically been exterminating them. He has burned out the eyes of young children with his ill-gotten poison, he has suffocated pregnant women, and he has put his own sword into the hearts of innocent men. And all for the crime of living just north of him.”<br /><br />Angoris rose to his feet. “Biagio has done worse!”<br /><br />“Yes, yes,” laughed Dakel. “Go on, dig your own grave.”<br /><br />“It’s true,” said the duke again. This time he pointed to a darkened alcove away from the candlelight, a place where one man sat, far apart from the spectators. “Biagio knows it’s true! Don’t you, butcher?”<br /><br />From his place in the shadows, Renato Biagio steepled his fingers and gave a tired sigh. He knew that neither Angoris nor the citizens could see him, and the veil of darkness served as a comforting cloak. He had expected Angoris’ outburst. Biagio settled into the plushness of his chair, reaching for a nearby brandy and sipping it thoughtfully. Dakel was in control, as always, and the Emperor of Nar wasn’t ruffled at all.<br /><br />“Emperor Biagio is not on trial here, Duke,” said the Inquisitor. “And I would strongly suggest you sit back down in your chair. You are the accused.”<br /><br />There was nowhere for Angoris to go, so the northerner sat back, enduring the growing snickers of the crowd. They loved a show, Biagio knew, and it was circus time in Nar. Angoris’ face turned an unpleasant shade of grey. Obviously, he was feeling the noose tighten.<br /><br />Biagio was tired from the long day and Dakel’s endless speeches, and it was only afternoon. Beyond the wall of the tower he still had a city to govern, and an empire beyond that. There were always so many pressing needs, so many questions to answer, so many hands to shake and deals to make. Biagio closed eyes that had lost their immortal radiance, and pictured his enormous bed back in the palace.<br /><br />To sleep, he thought dreamily. For a week, or a month...<br /><br />He could have slept for a year if it weren’t for the constant interruptions. He drained his glass of brandy and put the goblet down on the table beside him, then rose. The candelabra did a good job of blinding Angoris. Dakel had placed them perfectly, without needing Biagio’s guidance. Dakel was excellent at his work. And a loyal member of the Roshann, one of the few men in the Black City Biagio trusted at all these days. Angoris wasn’t the first of Biagio’s enemies to face the dancing antics of Dakel. Nor would he be the last.<br /><br />Biagio backed away from the stage, giving Angoris a final unseen look before departing through a private door. The Tower of Truth had dozens of hidden corridors where the members of the Roshann could escape the curious eyes of the Naren citizens that gathered for the entertainment. Dakel was master of the tower. Since Biagio’s ascension to emperor, the sharp-minded Inquisitor had become head of the Roshann. There had already been two attempts on the Inquisitor’s life. And Biagio himself had been the target of countless schemes. These days, Biagio often stayed in the shadows.<br /><br />Out in the hall he found his pair of Shadow Angels, his private guards, waiting for him, silent behind their implacable silver skull masks. He walked past his men who followed directly on his heels, and left behind the thundering voice of Dakel, still ringing in the amphi-chamber.<br /><br />Biagio’s head was pounding and his eyes drooped from lack of sleep. He longed to return to the Black Palace, to escape the thousand pressures plaguing him. Lost in a fog, he moved through the tower’s marble halls and soon found himself at the gate where his carriage awaited. The elaborate conveyance was carved from mahogany and pulled by a team of black horses. Besides the driver, there were a dozen more Shadow Angels on horseback around the vehicle, ready to protect their master. A slave bowed to Biagio as he stepped through the gate and approached his carriage, then rushed to open its door. He was fair-haired, barely seventeen, with a pretty face and a lean body that sent the emperor’s heart racing. But Biagio was too tired to pay the boy more notice, so he merely stepped into the carriage and collapsed into its leather cushions, watch- ing with relief as the slave sealed him inside, blessedly alone. For the first time in hours, silence engulfed him. He watched through the carriage windows as his bodyguards mounted their horses and the vehicle lurched into motion.<br /><br />A thousand sky-scraping towers soared around him. Nar the Magnificent. The Black City.<br /><br />Biagio smiled. Home. And what a thankless battle it had been to return. Only a little more than a year had passed since he’d become emperor, but the memory of his bloody coup remained. He remembered it each time his food tasted off and he feared poisoning, or whenever word reached him of another civil war. A year ago he had set a chain of events into motion and now he was struggling to stop the reaction. Renato Biagio tilted his head against the window and watched the city pass by. The Black Palace dominated the distance like a giant’s many-fingered hand. A familiar pall of smoke obscured the sun, setting the horizon aflame with Nar’s peculiar glow, and the countless smokestacks of the foundries and incinerators rumbled up their noxious gases, spitting them high into the sky.<br /><br />It was all so familiar, and yet it was somehow different. Nar City had been happier when Arkus was emperor. It had been more stable, more predictable. Everyone accepted that Arkus’ rule would last forever. But not so for this new emperor. Biagio’s rule was tenuous, and everyone in the Empire knew it. It was why there were civil wars and genocide in Nar, why little men like Angoris were able to do such big things. Each week a new report of atrocities reached Biagio in his palace, new breakouts of unrest, new assassinations of kings. Nar had gone mad in the last year, a result of Biagio’s miscalculations. He had predicted trouble upon his return from exile, but not on the grand scale that was plaguing Nar now.<br /><br />Biagio winced as his carriage passed the rubble where the Cathedral of the Martyrs had stood. The empty site was a symbol of all he’d done wrong. The backlash from destroying the cathedral had been far worse than he’d anticipated. He had guessed that Herrith’s minions would flock to him for protection against Liss. But they were a loyal lot, almost as zealous as Herrith himself. And the archbishop’s loyalists had long memories. They knew it was Biagio who had gelded their religion. It was he who had killed the bishop. It was he who had ordered the cathedral blown apart. And it was he who had murdered eleven Naren lords to steal the Iron Throne. Now no one trusted him.<br /><br />He closed his eyes, shutting out the cathedral’s ruins. The rubble was a constant, nagging reminder of all the work still ahead of him. He was no longer the same man that had masterminded the explosion, but he still had to prove that.<br /><br />“I have changed,” he whispered to himself. It was a mantra he chanted, a self-hypnosis to keep himself focused. Once, there had been Bovadin’s narcotic to keep his mind keen, but he had given up that drug in favor of sanity. Still, the cravings never really left him. And the withdrawal from the elixir had been hell itself. It had nearly killed him. But only nearly.<br /><br />“I yet live,” he said, laughing. No assassin had reached him, and if the Protectorate worked, no assassin ever would. Dakel and his long arm would pluck out all the cancers in the Empire, and Biagio would be safe. Nar would be at peace. There would be no more genocidal tyrants like Angoris, no more civil wars. And all of Nar would see that their emperor had changed, that now he was a man of justice and vision. A man worthy of the title.<br /><br />“I’m not insane anymore,” Biagio whispered. His eyes were still closed and his head still rested against the glass; the rhythmic swaying of the carriage was lulling.<br /><br />“Not insane...”<br /><br />Dyana Vantran had said he was mad, and she had been right. Years of imbibing Bovadin’s life-sustaining drug had turned his mind to slush. But he was slowly reclaiming himself. He had made great progress in the past year. And the Protectorate had so far worked wonderfully. The tribunal proved that he was a man of strength, despite the chaos rocking Nar. Though the fragments of the church and the legions of Nar distrusted him, Biagio still had his Roshann, and the Roshann still had their gallows. He could still engender fear when needed.<br /><br />Not everyone who came before the Protectorate was executed. Biagio insisted on proof before taking such actions. And it had to be politically expedient. Angoris was a tyrant, and the people of Dragon’s Beak hated him. Executing him would be a popular move. And popularity was important to Biagio these days. Soon all the nations that hated him would accept his rule. Even Talistan.<br /><br />He wondered if Elrad Leth was nearing the city, and how soon he could get the schemer before Dakel. But there would be time enough to deal with Talistan.<br /><br />Exhausted, Biagio let himself daydream and he didn’t think of Talistan or its sinister king, or of dark-robed Dakel lit by candlelight. Instead, his mind turned to Crote. His former island homeland would be bursting into spring, and the bittersweet image made the emperor smile. It was a long road back to the palace. Biagio seized on the image of golden beaches and, for a while, forgot his troubles.<br /><br />But before long the carriage stopped before the gates of the Black Palace. Biagio rubbed his eyes and straightened his garments, which had fallen sloppily around his body. The slave that had closed his carriage door now opened it, again bowing as he bid the emperor to step out. They were in the private courtyard around the palace, the first of many tiers surrounding the dizzying structure. A network of roads and stone stairways connected each tier to its successor, and the yard was scattered with horses, bodyguards, and servants. High above, Naren noblemen hung over balconies, watching their ruler return. The tallest spires disappeared into Nar’s perpetual haze.<br /><br />As he stepped out of the carriage, Biagio noticed two figures coming quickly toward him. One was small and dark with wild eyes. The other was tall and burly, more like a wall than a man. No one would ever have believed the two were brothers. They approached their emperor and sank to their knees, greeting him with practiced respect.<br /><br />“Welcome home, my lord,” said the smaller man. He raised his head and smiled at Biagio, who knew at once that he was hiding something.<br /><br />“Get that ridiculous grin off your face and tell me what’s on your tiny mind, Malthrak,” Biagio ordered.<br /><br />Malthrak of Isgar and his brother Donhedris both got to their feet. Donhedris was typically silent, letting his sibling do the talking.<br /><br />“Can you not guess, my lord?” said Malthrak mischievously. He was in Biagio’s good graces, and so took annoying chances. “You haven’t seen, have you?”<br /><br />“Seen what?” rumbled Biagio. “Tell me, Malthrak, or I shall have your liver for dinner.”<br /><br />“There,” said Malthrak, pointing over the emperor’s shoulder. “In the harbor.”<br /><br />Biagio’s eyes followed his underling’s finger. They were high enough to see the city’s harbor, choked as always with trading ships. But today there was something else in the inlet, a vast, black ship with armor plating and towering masts that flew the flag of Nar.<br /><br />“The Fearless,” Biagio whispered. “Damn ...”<br /><br />The Fearless dwarfed the ships around it, smothering them beneath its dominating shadow. Its sails were furled and its twin anchors were plunged into the depths. Biagio’s head began to thunder, and he put a hand to his temple to massage away the pressure. This was a surprise he didn’t need.<br /><br />“Is he ashore yet?” he asked.<br /><br />“Unfortunately, yes. He’s waiting for you inside your reading parlor.”<br /><br />“Has he said anything?”<br /><br />“No, my lord,” replied Malthrak. Then his nose crinkled and he added, “Well, that’s not precisely true. He did mumble something about Liss.”<br /><br />“Oh, yes,” laughed Biagio. “I’m sure he did. Very well. Go and tell him I’ll be in directly. Get him something to drink and eat. Something expensive. Try to ... ,” the emperor shrugged, “make him comfortable.”<br /><br />Malthrak nodded and scurried away, his big, wordless brother following close behind. Biagio watched them disappear into the palace, then took his time following. He wanted to think before meeting Nicabar, but he didn’t want to keep the admiral waiting too long, either. Surely his friend would be enraged. And Biagio had half-expected the visit anyway. But now he needed to summon the old Crotan charm and diplomacy. Nicabar was a very old, very dear friend. Surely he would be able to handle him.<br /><br />The “parlor,” as Malthrak called it, was a private reading room Biagio kept for himself on the first of the palace’s many floors. It was a comfortable room housing the collection of rare books and manuscripts Biagio had assembled from around the Empire. Because of its location, Biagio often greeted dignitaries there. Nicabar had known exactly where to go.<br /><br />Once inside the palace, Biagio doffed his cape, handing it to another of the ubiquitous slaves, then headed off toward the parlor to meet his old ally. These had been difficult days for the two of them. Since helping his friend win the Iron Throne, Nicabar had turned his attention back to Liss. The admiral had spent the past year in a bloody campaign against the seafarers, a protracted waste of blood and energy that had gained him few victories. Now Biagio needed peace with Liss — especially with ambitious Talistan nipping at his heels.<br /><br />Biagio slowed a little as he neared the parlor. The collection of statues lining the hall stared at him. Suddenly he was afraid to face Nicabar. He was emperor, but that didn’t make things easier. What he was about to do frightened him.<br /><br />Outside the parlor, two of Nicabar’s officers waited, guarding the door. Not surprisingly, Malthrak and Donhedris were there as well. Next to them were a pair of Shadow Angels, keeping a conspicuous eye on the men from the Fearless. The Shadow Angels were everywhere now. Biagio preferred them to the legionnaires, who no longer served the emperor unquestionably since the murder of their general, Vorto. The two skull helms turned toward Biagio, then to the sailors. Nicabar’s men bowed courteously and stepped aside.<br /><br />Biagio pushed open the door and stepped into the parlor. The drapes were opened wide letting sunlight pour inside. At the far end of the chamber, his back turned toward the door as he stared out over the city, was Admiral Danar Nicabar. The officer had a glass of wine in his hand and was swirling it absently, lost in thought. Biagio could almost feel the fury rising off him. He put on a smile and closed the door behind him. Nicabar did not turn around. There was a long, uncomfortable pause before either of them spoke.<br /><br />“Renato,” said Nicabar at last, “I’m very angry.”<br /><br />“Indeed, my friend? Too angry to greet me properly?”<br /><br />“Too angry to call you friend,” sneered Nicabar. He turned from the window, slamming his glass down on the sill. The glass slipped and shattered on the floor, but Nicabar ignored it as he stalked toward Biagio. “Why did you order the war labs to curtail my shipments of fuel?”<br /><br />Biagio folded his arms over his chest. “Do not presume to bark at me, Danar,” he warned. “I’ve not the character for it. You’re here to discuss this matter. Fine. I expected you to come. But do not shout at me like a cabin boy. I am your emperor.”<br /><br />“I put you here!” Nicabar growled. He was taller than Biagio by at least a foot, and the imposing figure would have made a lesser man cower. But Biagio did not cower. He locked eyes with the admiral and returned his steely gaze.<br /><br />“How dare you keep that fuel from me!” Nicabar continued. “If it wasn’t for me you wouldn’t be emperor. I need that fuel for my cannons!”<br /><br />“Danar,” cautioned Biagio. “Sit down. And try to calm yourself. I have my reasons for stopping shipment of your fuel. I will tell you why in my own time and manner. But you will sit.”<br /><br />There was enough edge to the command to make Nicabar’s face soften. He took a deep, unsteady breath, found a chair, and collapsed into it with an angry grunt. “I didn’t come here for word games, Renato,” he said impatiently. “I want answers. Why were my shipments of fuel stopped? And don’t tell me it’s because you still want peace with those Lissen devils. I swear, if you say that I’ll scream.”<br /><br />“Hmm, then perhaps I should cover my ears.”<br /><br />“Goddamn it, no!” Nicabar made a fist and slammed it into the armrest. “You promised me!”<br /><br />“I did promise you,” Biagio admitted. “What can I say? Things change.”<br /><br />“So, you’re not as good as your word then, eh? You forget too quickly, old friend. My navy put you on the throne. And I did it for a price. You knew the bargain. I won’t let you change it. I am going after Liss.”<br /><br />“You cannot,” said Biagio. He took a step closer to the admiral, deciding on a softer tack. “Danar, look around. Open your eyes. Your obsession with Liss is costing us too dearly. We must have peace with them. The Empire is tearing itself apart and you’re off on some mad vendetta. I need you here in Nar. I need you to keep me strong.”<br /><br />Nicabar laughed bitterly. “My God, you do forgive easily, don’t you? It’s not just my vendetta, Renato. It’s supposed to be yours, too. The Lissens have your homeland. How can you not care?”<br /><br />“I do care,” Biagio countered. “But it was the price of winning the throne. Everyone needs to make sacrifices, Danar. Even you.”<br /><br />Nicabar shook his head. “I’m done with that. I’ve sacrificed enough of my honor already. Ten years. That’s a long bloody time to fight. Now you’re asking me to wait even more? Forget it. Jelena’s still building her forces, Renato. Have you considered that?”<br /><br />Biagio had considered it heavily. The child queen of Liss was far more resilient than he’d anticipated, and her forces were growing stronger. It was just one more of his miscalculations. But it didn’t change the equation.<br /><br />“Peace,” Biagio said. “That’s the only answer.” He went down to one knee beside the admiral’s chair. “Be my friend, Danar. Do this thing for me.”<br /><br />Nicabar turned away, suddenly uncomfortable, but Biagio seized his hand. It was deathly cold, like his own had once been.<br /><br />“Look at me,” Biagio commanded.<br /><br />Nicabar complied and Biagio gazed into his comrade’s unnaturally blue eyes, seeing the same narcotic madness that had once stared back at him from mirrors. But how could he reach him? It was nigh impossible to break the bonds of Bovadin’s elixir. That desire had to come from deep within, and Nicabar seemed not to possess it. Biagio smiled at his friend, pitying his insatiable rage.<br /><br />“We’ve been friends a long time, Danar,” he said. “I owe you a lot. I know that. But it will all be for nothing if you keep pursuing Liss. We will lose the Empire and everything we’ve fought for. You’ve seen the chaos. You know I’m right.”<br /><br />Nicabar was unreachable. “All I know is your promise to me. You said I could destroy Liss once you took the throne. Well, it’s been a year now. Will you break your pledge to me? Or will you reinstate my cannon fuel?”<br /><br />“Danar...”<br /><br />“That’s your choice, Renato. It’s bleak, but there it is.”<br /><br />“Danar, Talistan — ”<br /><br />“Burn Talistan,” spat Nicabar. “Burn and blast it! Blast Dragon’s Beak and Doria and Casarhoon, too. I don’t give a damn about any of them. Liss is what I live for, Renato. I will have them, and I will crush them.” He snatched his hand away from Biagio. “And you won’t stop me, old friend.”<br /><br />It was a poorly veiled threat, and it stunned Biagio. He got to his feet.<br /><br />“You will fight me, then?” he asked, struggling to control his resentment. “You’ll join in the chorus for my head? Why don’t you just sail your navy to Talistan, Danar? Join with the rest of my enemies?”<br /><br />“Your promise,” Nicabar insisted. “All I want is for you to make good on it.”<br /><br />“I can’t, you fool!” roared Biagio. “I am Emperor of Nar! I have more important things than your petty revenge.” He stalked around the room like a tiger, enraged and frustrated at Nicabar’s stupidity. “God help me, I can’t make war with Liss. I can’t even win back my homeland, because Nar needs me. We’ll have war if we don’t stop Talistan, Danar. Worldwide war. And if you’re off battling Liss, who will be here to stand against them?”<br /><br />The admiral merely shrugged. “Give me the fuel,” he said calmly, “and I won’t oppose you. I will fight my own war and win back Crote for you. That I promise. Just give me the fuel.”<br /><br />“And if I don’t?”<br /><br />“Then I will take the navy away from you, Renato. I will fight the Lissens without cannons and you will be weaker than you are now, with no navy.” The admiral grinned. “And no army.”<br /><br />Checkmate, thought Biagio blackly. He turned slowly toward the window, stalling as he groped through the political maze. Nicabar was right. He had no army. The legionnaires wouldn’t follow him because he’d murdered their general. He was emperor in name only because he had the threat of Nicabar’s fleet behind him. Without that, his hold on the throne might crumble in a day.<br /><br />Yet Nicabar had forced his hand, forgetting that the emperor was the Roshann and the Roshann was everywhere. Biagio had made a life out of contingencies. The emperor sighed. He had loved Nicabar like a brother once.<br /><br />“That’s final, is it?” he asked over his shoulder. He saw Nicabar nod in the window’s reflection.<br /><br />“It is. Just keep your promise, and you’ll have no trouble from me. Order the war labs to release the fuel.”<br /><br />“I’m not wrong about Talistan, Danar. Gayle is planning something.”<br /><br />“The fuel, Renato.”<br /><br />“Very well,” agreed the emperor. “I will speak to Bovadin about it. He’ll order the war labs to provide your flame cannon fuel. You will have it by tomorrow.”<br /><br />“Then that’s when we’ll set sail,” Nicabar said, springing from his chair.<br /><br />“But you’re not going to Crote, are you?” said Biagio. “You’re planning to attack Liss.”<br /><br />Nicabar blanched. “How did you know?”<br /><br />“Oh, please, Danar. I still have some sources.” Biagio rubbed his hands together. “Well, that does sound promising. Liss itself! My, you are confident, eh?”<br /><br />“I can beat them this time, Renato,” rumbled Nicabar. “Once I’ve gathered the intelligence I need, find a weak spot to attack ...”<br /><br />“Yes, yes, I’m sure you’re right, Danar. Good luck to you, then. But keep in touch, all right?”<br /><br />“Don’t be sarcastic, Renato. I am right this time. I will beat them.”<br /><br />You’ve been saying that for years, you fool, thought Biagio.<br /><br />“Of course you’ll beat them,” he said. “I wish you all the luck in the world. And you wish me luck, don’t you, Danar? I mean, when Talistan rolls its horsemen into the Black City and all the nations of Nar clamor for my skin, I will have your best wishes, won’t I?”<br /><br />The two men shared a charged glance, then Admiral Nicabar backed away, shaking his head. Biagio thought of stopping his comrade before he left, but it was too late and Biagio wasn’t in the mood to apologize. Nicabar left the door open as he exited the parlor and stormed off down the hall, his two sailors falling in step behind him. Quick-thinking Malthrak shut the door again, guessing correctly that his master wanted to be alone.<br /><br />“Goddamn it,” groaned Biagio. He went to the chair that Nicabar had vacated and fell into it, exhausted and angry. All his efforts had been for nothing. Nicabar was obsessed with Liss and would never forsake that struggle. Nicabar didn’t care if Tassis Gayle and his henchman Leth were plotting against the throne, and he didn’t care if tyrants like Angoris murdered people by the thousands. He just wanted Liss. Biagio laughed. Once he himself had bargained away his humanity for power. It was what the drug did to men.<br /><br />“Malthrak!” shouted Biagio suddenly. “Get in here!”<br /><br />Within a moment the parlor door opened and Malthrak stuck his swarthy head inside. “My lord?” he queried. “Are you all right?”<br /><br />“Find me Captain Kasrin, Malthrak. Find out where he is and bring him.”<br /><br />Malthrak looked puzzled. “Kasrin?”<br /><br />“Of the ship Dread Sovereign. He’s in a harbor somewhere north of the city. I want to see him. And I don’t want anyone finding out about it, understand? Secret things, Malthrak.”<br /><br />Malthrak grinned. Secret things were what he was best at. “I understand, my lord. I’ll find him.”<br /><br />“Go quickly,” said Biagio. “And shut the door.”<br /><br />The little Roshann agent sealed his emperor into the parlor. Outside, Biagio could hear him murmuring to his brother. Malthrak would find Kasrin quickly and bring him to the Black City. And Donhedris had an errand of his own. According to Dakel, Elrad Leth’s ship had been sighted nearing the city.<br /><br />The emperor took a deep breath. He thought of Nicabar and all the good times they had enjoyed together. But that was the past. A year ago, when Biagio was still addicted to the drug, killing had been easy for him. He never felt anxious or afraid, and he never felt remorse over any of his orders, no matter how bloody. Withdrawing from the narcotic had changed all that, and sometimes he yearned for the old harshness again.<br /><br />“Forgive me, my friend,” he whispered. “I will miss you.”<br /></p>Copyright 2001 by John Marco     31515\n",

Founded in 1959 with the purpose of disseminating the most recently developed scientific information to groups in industry, government, high schools, and universities, REA has since become a successful and highly respected publisher of study aids, test preps, handbooks, and reference works. <br /><br />REA's Test Preparation series includes study guides for all academic levels in almost all disciplines. Research &amp; Education Association publishes test preps for students who have not yet completed high school, as well as high school students preparing to enter college. Students from countries around the world seeking to attend college in the United States will find the assistance they need in REA's publications. For college students seeking advanced degrees, REA publishes test preps for many major graduate school admission examinations in a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, law, and medicine. Students at every level, in every field, with every ambition can find what they are looking for among REA's publications. <br />While most test preparation books present practice tests that bear little resemblance to the actual exams, REA's series presents tests that accurately depict the official exams in both degree of difficulty and types of questions. REA's practice tests are always based upon the most recently administered exams, and include every type of question that can be expected on the actual exams. <br /><br />REA's publications and educational materials are highly regarded and continually receive an unprecedented amount of praise from professionals, instructors, librarians, parents, and students. Our authors are as diverse as the fields represented in the books we publish. They are well-known in their respective disciplines and serve on the faculties of prestigious high schools, colleges, and universities throughout the United States and Canada.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 1: SCORING HIGH ON THE ACT ASSESSMENT</b><br /><br /><b>ABOUT OUR BOOK</b> <br />This book has the tools to effectively prepare you for the ACT Assessment. It contains five full-length practice exams complete with answer keys and detailed explanations for each question, along with a topical review for each of the five individual tests that make up the ACT. All of the practice exams we provide are based on the latest ACT test administrations and contain every type of question that you can expect to encounter on the actual exam. <br /><br /><b>ABOUT THE ACT</b><br /><b>Who Takes the ACT and What is It Used for?</b><br />The ACT is usually taken by high school juniors and seniors. The exam is used by college admissions officers as a way to fairly judge all the students who apply to their school. Because high schools across the United States use many different grading systems, ACT scores put everyone on more of an equal footing. Your ACT scores, along with other information provided by you and your high school, help colleges predict how well you will do at the college level.<br /><br />If you don't do well on the ACT, don't panic! The exam can be taken over so that you can work on improving your scores. It's also not the be-all and end-all that you might think it is. Admissions officers use a number of criteria to judge applicants: Grade-point average, extracurricular activities, on-campus interviews, and the degree to which you've been taking challenging courses in high school are all factors that go into the mix. REA believes you have every reason to believe that, with enough of the right preparation, you can and should score well on the ACT. Nonetheless, you shouldn't think that not doing so will necessarily jeopardize your chances of attending the college of your choice. The very fact that you picked up this book, however, means that you're not one to leave much to chance. Having our test prep at your side as you approach test day will give you the extra shot of confidence we all sometimes need to climb the ladder of success.<br /><br /><b>Who Administers the ACT?</b><br />The ACT is developed and administered by ACT, Inc., and involves the assistance of educators throughout the country. The development process is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the exam are appropriate.<br /><br /><b>When and Where is the ACT Given?</b><br />You should try to take the exam early in your junior or senior year so that you will have another opportunity to take it if you are not satisfied with your performance. Taking our practice exams will familiarize you with the types of questions and format of the ACT so that you do not have to go through the anxiety of learning about the ACT during the actual exam.<br /><br />The ACT is usually administered five times a year throughout the country. It is given at hundreds of locations, including high schools. The usual testing day is Saturday, but the exam can be taken on an alternate day if a conflict, such as a religious obligation, exists.<br /><br />To receive information on upcoming administrations of the ACT, consult the ACT Registration Bulletin, which can be obtained from your guidance counselor, or contact ACT, Inc., directly at:<br /><br />ACT Registration <br />Phone: (319) 337-1270 (Weekdays 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ct)<br />Website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.act.org\">www.act.org</a><br />Online registration or registration by phone is recommended<br /><br />To take the ACT, you must pay a registration fee. A fee waiver may be granted in certain situations. To find out if you qualify, ask your guidance counselor. <br /><b>SSD Accommodations for Students with Disabilities<br /></b>Many students qualify for extra time to take the ACT Assessment. To learn about the documentation policy, the types of accommodations available, and registration procedures, visit <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.act.org/aap/disab\">www.act.org/aap/disab</a>.<br /><br /><b>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</b><br /><b>What Do I Study First?</b><br />Begin your studies by first taking our written diagnostic exam. The tables that follow include an answer key to score your exam, and also explain what review material you need to study if you answer a question incorrectly. <br /><br />After taking the written diagnostic exam, you may wish to continue your study by moving on to our Practice Exams I and II. Or, if you prefer, first study our reviews, which are designed to provide you with the information and strategies you need to do well on the ACT.<br /><br />Complete your preparation by taking the remaining two practice exams. For the most benefit, be sure to simulate actual testing conditions. Sit at a table in a quiet room and be sure to time yourself. Doing so will help you become familiar with the format and procedures involved with taking the actual ACT, and should help alleviate some of your test-taking anxiety.<br /><br />To best utilize your study time, follow our ACT Independent Study Schedule, which you'll find in the front of this book. The schedule is based on a ten-week program, but can be condensed to five weeks if necessary.<br /><br /><b>When Should I Start Studying?</b><br />It is never too early to start studying for the ACT. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the exam material. The sooner you learn the format of the exam, the more time you will have to familiarize yourself with it.<br /><br /><b>FORMAT OF THE ACT ASSESSMENT</b><br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>English - 45 minutes - 75 questions</u>\\n</b><br /><i>Usage/Mechanics</i><br />- Punctuation 13% 10 multiple-choice<br />- Basic Grammar &amp; Usage 16% 12 multiple-choice<br />- Sentence Structure 24% 18 multiple-choice<br /><i>Rhetorical Skills</i><br />- Strategy 16% 12 multiple-choice<br />- Organization 15% 11 multiple-choice<br />- Style 16% 12 multiple-choice<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>Mathematics 60 minutes - 60 questions</u>\\n</b> <br /><i>Pre-Algebra / Elem.

These questions test your knowledge of punctuation, your understanding of basic grammar and usage, and your recognition of proper sentence structure.<br />- <i>Rhetorical Skills:</i> (35 questions) You will be tested on your ability to recognize the strategy of a piece of writing, and to choose expressions and sentences which will support that strategy. Your skill level in organizing ideas and judging statements in context will also be tested. Finally, your ability to select precise and appropriate words and images, avoid ambiguous or ineffective writing, and write economically will be tested.<br /><br /><b>Mathematics Test</b><br />In the Mathematics Test, you will encounter standard multiple-choice questions. The test covers five areas, but you will receive three subscores based on the following topics:<br />- <i>Pre-Algebra/Elementary Algebra:</i> (24 questions) These questions test your knowledge of whole numbers, decimals, integers, fractions, linear equations, algebraic equations, and your ability to solve a quadratic equation.<br />-<i> Intermediate Algebra and Coordinate Geometry:</i> (18 questions) You will be tested on graphing in the coordinate plane, operations with integer exponents, radical and rational expressions, the quadratic formula, linear inequalities in one variable, and systems of two linear equations in two variables.<br />-<i> Plane Geometry/Trigonometry:</i> (18 questions) These questions evaluate your knowledge of the properties and relations of figures on the geometric plane, right triangle trigonometry, graphing trigonometric functions, and basic trigonometric identities.<br /><br /><b>Reading Test</b><br />The Reading passages cover topics in social studies, the natural sciences, prose fiction, and the humanities. You will receive two subscores based on the following areas:<br />-<i> Social Studies/Natural Sciences: </i>(20 questions) The Social Studies questions will evaluate you on a passage that may come from history, political science, anthropology, psychology, or sociology. The Natural Science questions will test you on a passage from biology, chemistry, physics, or the physical sciences.<br />- <i>Arts/Literature:</i> (20 questions) Questions on the Arts will be based on a passage covering art, music, philosophy, theater, architecture, or dance. The Literature questions will evaluate you based on a passage that is a complete short story, or an excerpt from a short story or novel.<br /><br /><b>Science Reasoning Test</b><br />The Science Reasoning Test has seven passages, which are taken from the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, and the physical sciences (this includes astronomy, geology, and meteorology). Rather than test your recall of scientific content, or your skill in mathematics or reading, these questions seek to evaluate your ability to reason scientifically. The information will be conveyed in one of three formats:<br />- <i>Data Representation: </i>(15 questions) These questions ask you to read tables, graphs, or scatter plots. Your ability to read and interpret information presented in this format will be measured.<br />-<i> Research Summaries:</i> (18 questions) You will be presented with descriptions of one or more related experiments. Questions in this format will focus on experimental design and ask you to interpret the experimental results.<br />- <i>Conflicting Viewpoints: </i>(7 questions) These questions will be based on a reading passage that presents several hypotheses or views that are inconsistent with each other. You will be asked to understand, analyze, and compare these conflicting viewpoints or hypotheses. <b>Writing Test</b>The Writing Test measures the writing skills taught in high school and in entry-level college composition courses. You are given one writing prompt that presents an issue, and a description of two points of view on that issue. You are then asked to write one essay presenting your own opinion. You may defend either of the points of view described in the prompt, or you may present a different perspective on the issue. Your score will not be affected by the point of view you choose.<br /><br /><b>ABOUT THE REVIEW SECTIONS</b><br />The reviews in this book are designed to help you sharpen the basic skills needed to approach the ACT as well as provide strategies for attacking each type of question. A separate review is presented for each ACT test: English, Mathematics, Reading, Science Reasoning, and Writing. Drills are provided to reinforce what you have learned. By using the reviews in conjunction with the practice tests, you will better prepare yourself for the actual exam.<br /><br /><b>SCORING THE ENGLISH, MATH, READING, AND SCIENCE REASONING TESTS</b><br /><b>When Will I Receive My Score Report and What Will It Look Like?</b><br />You will receive your ACT score report three to eight weeks after you take the test. Aside from you, only your high school, the colleges you indicated on your answer sheet, and scholarship services will see your scores.<br /><br />Your score report will contain your scaled scores for each of the four tests, and your composite score. Your subscores for the English, Mathematics, and Reading tests will also be noted. As mentioned, they are scored independently, and will not necessarily add up to the scaled score for each test. For example, the three Mathematics subscores will not necessarily add up to your scaled score in Mathematics. If you take the Writing Test, your score report will contain the Writing Test score and the Combined English/Writing score. The score report will also denote percentiles for each scaled score, subscore, and your composite score. This information tells you the number of students who took the same administration of the ACT and received scores equivalent to or lower than yours. Your composite score will also be ranked with those of enrolled first-year students at the colleges you indicated on your answer sheet.<br /><br /><b>STUDYING FOR THE ACT</b><br />It is very important to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some students may set aside a certain number of hours every morning, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other students may study during the day, while waiting on line, or even while eating lunch. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be the most effective. But be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a study routine and stick to it!<br /><br />When you take our written practice exams, try to make your testing conditions as much like the actual exam as possible. Turn your television and radio off, and sit down at a quiet table free from distraction. Make sure to time yourself. Start off by setting a timer for the time that is allotted for each test, and be sure to reset the timer for the appropriate amount of time when you start a new test.<br /><br />As you complete each diagnostic and practice exam, score your exam and thoroughly review the explanations to the questions you answered incorrectly; however, do not review too much at one time. Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review until you are confident that you completely understand the material.<br /><br />Since you will be allowed to write in your test booklet during the actual ACT, you may want to write in the margins and spaces of this book while practicing; however, do not make miscellaneous notes on your answer sheets. Mark each answer clearly and make sure the answer you have chosen corresponds to the question you are answering.<br /><br />Score your exams using the Scoring Worksheet and keep track of them. By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. You should carefully study the reviews that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas.<br /><br /><b>TEST-TAKING TIPS</b><br />Although you may not be familiar with standardized exams such as the ACT, there are many ways to acquaint yourself with this type of examination and help alleviate your test-taking anxieties. Listed below are ways to help you become accustomed to the ACT, some of which may be applied to other standardized tests as well.<br /><br /><i>Become comfortable with the format of the ACT</i>. When you are practicing, simulate the conditions under which you will be taking the actual exam. Stay calm and pace yourself. After simulating the exam a couple of times, you will boost your chances of doing well, and you will be able to sit down for the actual ACT with much more confidence.<br /><br /><i>Read all of the possible answers. </i>Just because you think you have found the correct response, do not automatically assume that it is the best answer. Read through each choice to be sure that you are not making a mistake by jumping to conclusions.<br /><br /><i>Use the process of elimination.</i> Go through each answer to a question and eliminate as many of the answer choices as possible. By eliminating two answer choices, you have given yourself a better chance of getting the item correct since there will only be two or three choices left from which to make your guess. Guess only if you can eliminate at least two answers.<br /><br /><i>Be careful if you use a calculator. </i>Calculators are now permitted on the mathematics portion of the test. However, all the questions can be solved without the use of a calculator. Use your judgment on when and where you should use a calculator. You may find that some questions are more easily solved without the use of a calculator. A good rule of thumb is to use a calculator only if you use it regularly in your classwork and homework. You should note that not all types of calculators are permitted. Unacceptable calculators include handheld or laptop computers, electronic writing pads or pen-input devices, pocket organizers, models with typewriter-style keypads, noisy or paper tape calculators, and calculators that require a power cord. You should make sure your calculator has fresh batteries and remember that sharing of calculators is prohibited.<br /><br /><i>Answer every question. </i>You are not penalized if you answer a question incorrectly. Try to use the guessing strategy even if you are truly stumped by a question, since there is still a possibility you will select the correct answer.<br /><br /><i>Work quickly and steadily.</i> You will have only 35 to 60 minutes to work on each test, so avoid focusing on any one problem too long. Take our practice exams to help you learn to budget your precious time.<br /><br /><i>Learn the directions and format for each test. </i>Familiarizing yourself with the directions and format of the different tests will not only save time, but will also help you avoid nervousness (and the mistakes caused by getting nervous).<br /><br /><i>Work the easier questions first.</i> If you find yourself working too long on one question, make a mark next to it in your test booklet and come back to it. After you have answered all the questions that you can, go back to the ones you have skipped.<br /><br /><i>Be sure that the answer oval you are marking corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet. </i>Since the tests are graded by machine, marking one wrong answer can throw off your answer key and score. Be extremely careful.<br /><br /><i>Eliminate the obviously wrong answers.</i> Sometimes an ACT question will have one or two answer choices that are a little odd. These answers will stick out as being wrong for one of several reasons: they may be impossible given the conditions of the problem, they may violate mathematical rules or principles, or they may be illogical. Being able to spot answers that are clearly wrong before you finish a problem gives you an advantage because you will be able to make a more educated guess from the remaining choices if you are unable to fully solve the problem.<br /><br /><i>Work from the answer choices. </i>One of the ways you can use a multiple-choice format to your advantage is to work backwards from the answer choices to solve a problem. This is not a strategy you can use all of the time, but it can be helpful if you can just plug the choices into a given formula or equation. The answer choices can often narrow the scope of the responses. You may be able to make an educated guess based on eliminating choices that you know do not fit into the problem.<br /><br /><b>THE DAY OF THE EXAM</b><br /><b>Before the Exam</b><br />On the day of the exam, you should wake up early and have a good breakfast. Make sure to dress comfortably, so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the test. Also plan to arrive at the test center early. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and relax before the exam, and will also spare you the anguish that comes with being late. As an added incentive to make sure you arrive early, keep in mind that no one will be allowed into the test session after the test has begun.<br /><br />Before you leave for the test center, make sure that you have your admission ticket and another form of identification, which must contain a recent photograph, your name, and signature (i.e., passport, driver's license, recently published photo, or a letter of identification from your school with photo attached). Check with your guidance counselor or ACT Administration if you have any questions about proper identification, since you will not be allowed in the test center without it. You must also bring several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, as none will be provided at the test center.<br /><br />If you would like, wear a watch to the test center. However, you may not wear one that has an alarm, as it may disturb other test-takers. No dictionaries, textbooks, notebooks, briefcases, or packages will be permitted and drinking, smoking, and eating are prohibited. Only your pencils and admission ticket will be permitted into the testing area. <br /><br /><b>During the Exam</b><br />Once you enter the test center, follow all of the rules and instructions given by the test supervisor. If you do not, you risk being dismissed from the test and having your ACT scores canceled. When all of the exam materials have been passed out, the test supervisor will give you directions for filling out your answer sheet. You must fill out this answer sheet carefully. Fill out your name exactly as it appears on your identification documents and admission ticket, unless otherwise instructed.<br /><br />Remember that you can write in your test booklet, as no scratch paper will be provided. Mark your answers in the appropriate spaces on the answer sheet. Each numbered row will contain four or five ovals corresponding to each answer choice for that question. Fill in the oval which corresponds to your answer darkly, completely, and in a neat manner. You can change you answer, but remember to completely erase your old answer. Only one answer should be marked. As your answer sheet will be machine-scored, stray lines or marks may cause the machine to score your answers incorrectly.<br /><br /><b>After the Exam</b><br />Once your exam materials have been collected, you will be dismissed. Your score report should be mailed out in four to eight weeks.<br />     29944\n",

Founded in 1959 with the purpose of disseminating the most recently developed scientific information to groups in industry, government, high schools, and universities, REA has since become a successful and highly respected publisher of study aids, test preps, handbooks, and reference works. <br /><br />REA's Test Preparation series includes study guides for all academic levels in almost all disciplines. Research &amp; Education Association publishes test preps for students who have not yet completed high school, as well as high school students preparing to enter college. Students from countries around the world seeking to attend college in the United States will find the assistance they need in REA's publications. For college students seeking advanced degrees, REA publishes test preps for many major graduate school admission examinations in a wide variety of disciplines, including engineering, law, and medicine. Students at every level, in every field, with every ambition can find what they are looking for among REA's publications. <br /><br />While most test preparation books present practice tests that bear little resemblance to the actual exams, REA's series presents tests that accurately depict the official exams in both degree of difficulty and types of questions. REA's practice tests are always based upon the most recently administered exams, and include every type of question that can be expected on the actual exams. <br /><br />REA's publications and educational materials are highly regarded and continually receive an unprecedented amount of praise from professionals, instructors, librarians, parents, and students. Our authors are as diverse as the fields represented in the books we publish. They are well-known in their respective disciplines and serve on the faculties of prestigious high schools, colleges, and universities throughout the United States and Canada.<br /><br /><b>CHAPTER 1 - PASSING THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs</b><br /><br /><b>ABOUT THIS BOOK</b><br />This book, part of REA's two-volume set for the most thorough preparation for the CLEP General Examinations available, provides you with an accurate and complete <br />review for the five CLEP General Computer-Based Tests, or CBTs. Inside you will find reviews - all based on the official CLEP exams - for each of the following subjects: English Composition (with and without Essay), Humanities, Mathematics, <br />Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences and History. You will also find drill questions that will help you prepare for the actual exam. For each drill, we provide an answer key with detailed explanations designed to help you better grasp and retain the test material.<br /><br /><b><i>This volume contains extensive topical reviews and drills prepared expressly to help you get ready for the CLEP General CBTs. Full length practice tests paralleling the actual exams are presented in our companion volume, REA's <u>The Best Test Preparation for the CLEP General Exams</u></i>.</b><br /><br /><b>ABOUT THE CLEP GENERAL CBTS</b><br /><br /><b>Who takes the CLEP General CBTs and what are they used for?</b><br />CLEP examinations are usually taken by people who have acquired knowledge outside the classroom and wish to bypass certain college courses and earn college credit. The College-Level Examination Program is designed to reward students for learning - no matter where or how that knowledge was acquired. More than 2,900 colleges grant credit and/or advanced standing for CLEP exams. This makes CLEP the most widely accepted credit-by-examination program in the country.<br /><br />Although most CLEP examinees are adults returning to college, many graduating high school seniors, enrolled college students, and international students also take the exams to earn college credit or to demonstrate their ability to perform at the college level. There are no prerequisites, such as age or educational status, for taking CLEP examinations. However, you must meet specific requirements of the particular institution from which you wish to receive CLEP credit.<br /><br />Most CLEP examinations include material usually covered in an undergraduate course with a similar title to that of the exam (e. g., History of the United States I). However, the five exams covered in this book do not deal with subject matter covered in any particular course but rather with material taken as general requirements during the first two years of college. These general exams are English Composition (with or without essay), Humanities, College Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences and History. <br /><br /><b>Who administers the exams?</b><br />The CLEP is developed by the College Board, administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS), and involves the assistance of educators throughout the country. The test development process is designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate.<br /><br /><b>When and where are the exams given?</b><br />The CLEP General Examinations are offered year-round at some 1,400 test centers in the United States and abroad. To find the test center nearest you and to register for the exam, you should obtain a copy of the free booklets CLEP Colleges and CLEP Information for Candidates and Registration Form, which are available at most colleges where CLEP credit is granted, or by contacting:<br /><br />CLEP Services<br />P.O. Box 6600<br />Princeton, NJ 08541-6600<br />Phone: (609) 771-7865<br />Website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.collegeboard.com\">http://www.collegeboard.com</a><br /><br /><b>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</b><br /><br /><b>What do I study first?</b><br />Read over this introduction and our suggestions for test-taking, take the first practice test in your subject to determine your area(s) of weakness, and then go back and focus your studying on those specific problems. Make copies of the appropriate answer sheets each time you take a practice test (answer sheets are located at the back of this book). Studying each subject thoroughly will reinforce the basic skills you will need to do well on the exam. Be sure to take the practice tests to become familiar with the format and procedures involved with taking the actual exam - and, of course, to make yourself completely comfortable with the material.<br /><br />To best utilize your study time, follow our CLEP General Examinations Independent Study Schedule located in the front of this book. This schedule is designed to guide you through one General Examination at a time. You should repeat the schedule for each exam for which you're preparing. The schedule is based on a six-week program but can be condensed to three weeks, if necessary, by collapsing each two-week period into one.<br /><br /><b>When should I start studying?</b><br />It is never too early to start studying for the CLEP General Examinations. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the test material. The sooner you learn the format of the exam, the more time you will have to familiarize yourself with it.<br /><br /><b>FORMAT OF THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs</b><br />The five computer-based CLEP General Examinations cover material taught in classes that most students take as requirements in the first two years of college. <br /><br />The General CBT in English Composition gauges the skills you would need to complete most first-year college composition courses. There are two versions of the English Composition exam - with essay and without essay. (Credit-granting policies differ among colleges. Check with your prospective school to find out which version is accepted.) The first version has approximately 90 multiple-choice questions, each with five possible answer choices, to be answered in 90 minutes. The second version has one section with approximately 50 multiple-choice questions, each with five answer choices, and a second section with one essay. The student has 45 minutes to complete each of the two sections. <br /><br />The approximate breakdown of topics is as follows:<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>All-Multiple-Choice Version</u>\\n</b><br /><br /><i>Skills at the Sentence Level (55%)</i><br />- Sentence boundaries<br />- Economy and clarity of expression<br />- Concord/Agreement: subject-verb; verb tense; pronoun reference, shift, number<br />- Active/passive voice<br />- Diction and idiom<br />- Syntax: parallelism, coordination, subordination, dangling modifiers<br />- Sentence variety<br /><br /><i>Types of Questions Associated with These Skills:</i><br />* Identifying Sentence Errors: Candidate pinpoints violations of standard conventions of expository writing.<br />* Improving Sentences: Candidate chooses the phrase, clause, or sentence that best conveys a sentence's intended meaning.<br />* Restructuring Sentences: Candidate chooses the phrase that, because it most effectively shifts a sentence's emphasis or improves its clarity, would most likely appear in the new sentence created by the revision.<br /><br /><i>Skills in Context (45%)</i><br />- Main idea, thesis<br />- Organization of ideas in paragraph or essay form<br />- Relevance of evidence, sufficiency of detail, levels of specificity<br />- Audience and purpose (effect of style, tone, language, or argument)<br />- Logic of argument (inductive, deductive reasoning)<br />- Coherence within and between paragraphs<br />- Rhetorical emphasis, effect<br />- Sustaining tense or point of view<br />- Sentence joining, sentence variety<br /><br /><i>Types of Questions Associated with These Skills:</i><br />* Revising Work in Progress: Candidate identifies ways to improve an early draft of an essay.<br />* Analyzing Writing: Candidate answers questions about two prose passages written in distinctly different styles and about the strategies used by the author of each passage.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>Multiple-Choice-with-Essay Version (Two Sections):</u>\\n</b><br /><br /><i>Section I - Multiple-Choice (50%)</i><br />- Skills at the Sentence Level (30%) See explanation for all-multiple-choice version.<br />- Skills in Context (20%) See explanation for all-multiple-choice version.<br /><br /><i>Section II - Essay (50%)</i><br />- Candidate presents a point of view in response to a topic and supports it with a logical argument and appropriate evidence.<br /><br />The Humanities CBT features 140 multiple-choice questions, each with five answer choices, to be answered in 90 minutes.

The reviews are designed to further students' understanding of the test material. Each review contains a description of what to expect on the examination and a thorough review of the major topics found on the exams.<br /><br />The English composition review is broken down into two areas - English language skills and writing skills. The humanities review is broken down into five areas - literature, visual arts and architecture, philosophy, music and performing arts. The mathematics review is broken down into seven areas - arithmetic, algebra, geometry and trigonometry, sets and logic, real and complex numbers, functions, and probability and statistics. The natural sciences review is broken down into seven areas - biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, geology, astronomy, and meteorology. The social sciences review is broken down into eight areas - political science, sociology, economics, psychology, geography, anthropology, western and world civilization, and United States history.<br /><br /><b>SCORING THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs</b><br />The CLEP General Examinations are scored on a scale of 200 to 800. This does not apply, however, to the English Composition with Essay Questions Exam. The essays on this exam are scored on a scale of 2 to 8. There is a drill question in the writing skills section of the English Composition review that asks you to write an essay on a given topic. To score your essay, we suggest you give it to two English teachers or professors to grade. Refer to the completed essays in the detailes explanations of answers section of the review for scoring criteria. The completed essays will show you what the judges will be looking for, and the essay score from the English teachers will help you judge your progress.<br /><br /><b>When will I receive my score report?</b><br />Right after you finish (except for the English Composition essay, which requires human graders and whose score will be mailed to you), the computer will generate a printout of your score report, which the administrator will hand you. If you want your scores reported to a college or other institution, you must fill in the correct code number on your answer sheet at the time you take the examination. Since your scores are kept on file for 20 years, you may also request transcripts from ETS at a later date.<br /><br /><b>STUDYING FOR THE CLEP GENERAL CBTs</b><br />It is crucial for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some students set aside a certain number of hours every morning, while others choose to study at night before going to sleep. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. But be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a study routine and stick to it!<br /><br />When you take our practice tests, try to make your testing conditions as much like the actual test as possible. Turn off the television or radio, and sit down at a quiet table or desk free from distraction. Use a timer to ensure that each section is accurately clocked.<br /><br />As you complete each practice test, score it and thoroughly review the explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly; however, do not review too much at one sitting. Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review until you are confident that you completely understand the material.<br /><br />Keep track of your scores and mark them on the scoring worksheet. By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. You should carefully study the review sections that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas.<br /><br />If you do poorly on a section, do not develop a negative attitude - it only means you need to further review the material. You should carefully study the reviews that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas. A negative attitude could prove to be your biggest stumbling block. It is important that you get a good start and that you are positive as you review and study the material.<br /><br /><b>TEST-TAKING TIPS</b><br />You may never have taken a standardized computer-based test, but it's not hard to learn the things you need to know to be comfortable on test day.<br /><br />Know the format of the CBT. CLEP CBTs are not adaptive but rather fixed-length tests. In a sense, this makes them kin to the familiar pen-and-paper exam in that you have the same flexibility to back and review your work in each section. Moreover, the format hasn't changed a great deal from the paper-and-pencil CLEP. You are likely to see some so-called pretest questions as well, but you won't know which they are and they won't be scored.<br /><br />Use the process of elimination. If you don't immediately see the correct answer among the choices, go down the list and eliminate as many as you can. Confidently casting aside choices will help you isolate the correct response, or at least knock your choices down to just a few strong contenders. This approach has the added benefit of keeping you from getting sidetracked and distracted by what in fact may be just an occasional tricky question. Importantly, your score is based only on the number of questions you answer correctly.<br /><br />Read all of the possible answers. Just because you think you have found the correct response, do not automatically assume that it is the best answer. Read through each choice to be sure that you are not making a mistake by jumping to conclusions.<br /><br />Work quickly and steadily. You will have only 45 minutes to work on an average of 50 questions in each section, so work quickly and steadily to avoid focusing on any one question too long. Taking our practice tests will help you learn to budget your time.<br /><br />Acquaint yourself with the CBT screen. Familiarize yourself with the CLEP CBT screen beforehand by logging onto the College Board Website. Waiting until test day to see what it looks like in the pretest tutorial risks injecting needless anxiety into your testing experience.<br /><br />Be sure that your answer registers before you go to the next item. Look at the screen to see that your mouse-click causes the pointer to darken the proper oval. This takes far less effort than darkening an oval on paper, but don't lull yourself into taking less care!<br /><br /><b>THE DAY OF THE EXAM</b><br /><br /><b>Preparing to Take the CLEP CBT</b><br />On the day of the test, you should wake up early (after a decent night's rest, one would hope) and have a good breakfast. Dress comfortably so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the test. Plan to arrive at the test center early. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and relax before the test, and will also spare you the anxiety that comes with being late. No one will be allowed into the test session after the test has begun.<br /><br />Before you set out for the test center, make sure that you have your admission form, Social Security number, and a photo ID with your signature (e.g., driver's license, student identification card, or current alien registration card). The test center administrator will ask you for photo ID when you arrive.<br /><br />After your test center fee is collected and registration is completed, you will be assigned to a computer. You will then key in the standard personal information, including credit card information. Next, you'll take the tutorial.<br /><br /><b>During the Test</b><br /><br />Finally the exam will be upon you. Here's what to expect:<br /><br />- Since it's built right into the CLEP testing software, an on-screen non-graphing scientific calculator will pop up for the College Mathematics CBT. You should take into account, however, that a calculator is not deemed necessary to answer any of the test's questions.<br /><br />- Scrap paper will be provided to you for all CLEP CBT examinations.<br /><br />- At times your computer may seem to slow down. Don't worry: the built-in timer will not advance until your next question is fully loaded and visible on screen.<br /><br />- Just as you can on a paper-and-pencil test, you'll be able to move freely between questions within a section.<br /><br />- You'll have the option to mark questions and review them.<br /><br />- You may wear a wristwatch to the test center, but it cannot make any noise which could disturb your fellow test-takers.<br /><br />- No computers, dictionaries, textbooks, notebooks, scrap paper, briefcases, or packages will be permitted into the test center; drinking, smoking, and eating are prohibited. You may, however, bring your own nonprogrammable calculator if you're sitting for the CLEP College Mathematics CBT. Consult College Board publications (including the Collegeboard.com website) for details.<br /><br /><b>After the Test</b><br />Once you have informed the test center administrator that you're done, you will end your session on the computer, which in turn will generate the printout of a score report (except for the English Composition essay, which requires human graders and whose score will be mailed to you) that the administrator will hand you. Then, go home and relax - you deserve it!<br />     28092\n",

                                                                    <br />\\n  <b>Chapter One: A Wrestler, a Comic or a Clown</b>\\n <p> </p><p> I'm not as old as you might think. It's just that I've been wrestling a long time. There's very few on the current World Wrestling Entertainment talent roster with more experience on the job than I have. The fact is I was born Darren Matthews on May 10, 1968 in a little village in the middle of England -- Codsall Wood in Staffordshire. Not a lot goes on in Codsall Wood. My dad Don Matthews is a builder and he built the house I was born in, just fifty yards from my grandfather's house, where my dad himself was born. </p><p> </p><p> Wrestling is one of my earliest memories. Whenever I could, I'd watch it on TV. I also loved that old show <i>The Comedians</i>, all those old gag-a-minute northern stand-up comics, and I loved Slade too, the glam rock band. Wrestling, comedy and showbusiness -- they were always going to play a big part in my life. </p><p> I was seven when my mum Paula left us. Mum and Dad had a massive row and my dad took me out in the car to see some of the houses he was building. He said to me: \"What would you think if you got home and your mum wasn't there?\" I don't remember being too bothered. I'd always looked up to my dad and he was the one I wanted to be around. But it must have affected me, because I took my frustrations out on other kids. They'd tease me in the playground, shouting, \"Where's your mum?\" For the only time in my life, I turned into a bully. There's nothing I hate worse now than a bully. That or a liberty-taker. I've no time for bullies -- and I met plenty of them when I became a wrestler. I try to live my life without having regrets, but the fact that I bullied other kids all those years ago is something that troubled me for a long time. </p><p> I used to be a right naughty lad. But then when I was about fifteen I woke up one day and the thought struck me: \"This is not the way to be.\" I couldn't carry on the way I had been. That was it. Simple as that. I've prided myself on my politeness from that day. </p><p> I hated every single minute of school. It's a terrible thing to admit when I know so many kids watch me on TV every week, but it's true. I detested it. My first school was a Catholic school, St Joseph's Convent, even though I'm not a Catholic. Mum leaving when I was so young didn't help matters, but I would never have been able to handle being preached at by those nuns in any case. I never liked being told that I'd go to hell if I didn't do what some nun told me to. </p><p> Just about the only highlight I remember from school was being taken on a trip to Chester Zoo when I was eight. My best friend was a lad called Andrew who had this curly thick white hair. He began pulling faces at a gorilla who retaliated by throwing a big pile of shite at him, hitting him square in the face. All you could see of Andrew were his eyes, peering through this steaming mask. The nuns were running around, shouting and screaming. It was like a <i>Tom and Jerry</i> cartoon. If that was the only thing I can remember from school, you can imagine how mind-numbing I found the place. </p><p> Then when I was nine I went to the middle school -- and was soon faced with another confusing situation. My mum had run off with this bloke and my dad ended up marrying his wife. It got pretty complicated. I've a half-brother who's my mum and step-dad's kid, and a step-sister. </p><p> My dad had custody of me and I'd go to stay with my mum in the school holidays, but I didn't like going. She lived in Bristol, a hundred miles away. When I was there I never saw much of my brother, who was always out with his friends. I didn't really know him, though we do keep in touch today. He's nice enough. But most of the time I didn't want to be there because I wanted to stay at home with my dad, granddad and the close family who lived nearby: my uncles, aunties and cousins -- especially my cousin Graham. He's older than me, but we spent so much time together growing up that he's more like a brother to me than anything else. </p><p> But my dad was always the one I looked up to. To this day he's the nicest man I've ever met -- and I'm not just saying that because he is my dad. He is the kindest person. I've never heard him swear or even say a bad word about anybody. He's a real hard worker, too. You never saw my dad without a pair of overalls on. He would come home covered in cement and has always worked hard for his living. </p><p> He doesn't need to work these days but he still does. He still gets up early every morning and never stops all day. If he didn't work he wouldn't know what to do with himself. Lately he has had problems both with his leg and with his arm but nothing stops him. I've seen him shovelling stuff with one hand. If he gave it up now he'd have no financial worries but that is who he is -- a grafter. But what it meant for me when I was growing up was that dad was often out at work. That meant I spent a lot of time with his father, my granddad. </p><p> Granddad's name was William Matthews, known as Bill, and he was probably the biggest influence in my life. In his younger days he was a bit of a rogue, well known for fighting and drinking. He'd do a bit of wrestling, a bit of boxing, a bit of running -- anything to make a few quid. He'd tell me stories about how he used to wrestle at a place called the Pear Tree pub. Back in the 1920s and 1930s they had a ring up in the beer garden where he used to do his stuff. He packed it in back in 1933, aged just thirty-two, because he came down with pleurisy and pneumonia. He also worked in Blackpool for a while. He was a navvy and there had been a lot of work going there when he was younger, on the sea walls and the like. </p><p> He used to tell me all these stories about him fighting when he was younger. He was a big, powerful fellow, over six feet tall, and he was a great character. He used to joke around and would teach me all these dirty stories and poems. He'd tell me all these things and whenever I repeated any of them to my mum, I'd get a thick ear for it. I've still got a picture of him in a suit and the older I get, the more I look like him. </p><p> He died in 1990, when he was eighty-nine. He loved it when I started wrestling and travelling around the world. Even when I'd moved to Blackpool, I'd come back to see him more than I would most people. Whenever I was passing through the Midlands on the wrestling trips that would take me all over the country, I'd stop over with him. </p><p> He drank all his life and smoked a pipe. He'd had every disease you care to name but in the end, the only reason he died was because he had got fed up with living. My gran had died a few years before and he used to tell me there was nothing on TV he wanted to watch any more, nothing he wanted to do. The last time I saw him, he told me: \"I'm going to die, son.\" </p><p> \"Don't be so soft,\" I said. I told him I was due to go to South Africa two weeks later to wrestle. </p><p> \"Don't stay,\" he said. \"Get yourself gone.\" </p><p> He died soon after. I did what he'd told me and went to South Africa. That was the way it was between him and me. </p><p> </p><p> When I got to Codsall High School I had the same trouble as before. It bored the life out of me. Things that I liked, I did okay at, such as woodwork. But something I didn't like -- French for example -- was another matter. I got thrown out of French for being a disruptive little git. </p><p> If there is anything I want to learn about I'll do it on my own. I read constantly these days, and have always tried to educate myself. But when they tried to teach me a load of old cobblers it drove me up the wall. I was one of the lads sitting at the back of the class, being sarcastic and messing around all the time. Because I never thought I'd need any of it. I'd always known what I was going to do. I was going to be a wrestler. </p><p> I remember one of my last days at Codsall High, when I was sent to see the careers officer. \"What are you going to do?\" he asked me. \"Are you going to get a trade?\" </p><p> \"No,\" I said. \"I'm going to be a wrestler.\" </p><p> He threw me out of the office and told me to come back when I wanted to talk some sense. I expect he's still there today. </p><p> </p><p> Now mine is not a rags to riches tale. I didn't become a wrestler because I wanted to be rich and famous. We weren't badly off. My dad owned his own business and we lived in a lovely village, in a beautiful home, because my dad had built it. I was fortunate. We'd go on good holidays -- Jersey, Guernsey, Spain, Tunisia. We never went without. </p><p> But when I became a wrestler, I made myself poor. Some of my friends and family were almost as surprised as the careers officer had been. Everyone expected me to take over the family business from my dad, but I knew I could never work a regular job. Even when I helped my dad out at weekends, I knew I couldn't hack that life. I'm not decrying anyone who can -- good luck to them. My dad's a grafter, and my mum too - she's a nurse. But it wasn't for me. </p><p> One reason was the way I saw people treat my dad. He'd do jobs for them and then they wouldn't want to pay him. It used to drive me wild. I was going to be a wrestler and that's all there was to it. A wrestler or a clown or a comedian. I've ended up becoming a mixture of all three. </p><p> </p><p> My dad used to take his young, wrestling-mad son to Wolverhampton Civic Hall every two weeks to see Dale Martin's shows. It was great. I watched all the stars of the day, people who affected me and whose inspiration I still use in my own act now. There was Giant Haystacks, Big Daddy, Kendo Nagasaki, The Royal Brothers, Mick McManus and Cyanide Sid Cooper -- I was always a huge fan of his and use a lot of his material today. </p><p> On my eighth birthday I was taken to see Mick McManus at Wolverhampton Civic Hall and it must be the greatest birthday present anyone has ever given me. Around 1975 I saw Dynamite Kid there when he was just sixteen and he was awesome. He was only a little kid and he wasn't flying around like he did later in his career, but you could already tell how good he was going to be. He was full of energy, moved like a sparkplug. </p><p> One night he wrestled another guy I liked a lot, Tally Ho Kaye, in a street fight. Tally Ho did a foxhunting gimmick and the idea was for the two of them to fight in their street clothes. Tally Ho had a really posh outfit on, all polished boots and brass buttons, and Dynamite turned up in a sports jacket, tie, jeans and a pair of Doc Martens. Tally Ho used Dynamite's tie to strangle him - it was brilliant stuff. I was intrigued by all this drama and theatre. I didn't care about all those people who said it was bent. I was hooked. </p><p> I used to run round collecting autographs from all the wrestlers. That's why I always give autographs now, as long as I have the time -- I can remember when I was the excited kid with the pen and the notebook. I can't always oblige. If I'm rushing for a plane it can be difficult, but I'll always apologize if I can't. I always used to sign for everyone who asked but these days it is less likely to be a handful and more likely to be hundreds or thousands. Sometimes, if I see 250 kids and I know I'll only be able to do two or three, I'd rather not do any at all and let them think I'm a bit of a dick. I would feel badly for all the people I couldn't do. </p><p> </p><p> My being such a starstruck wrestling fan wasn't so unusual back then. All of Britain was hooked on it. They say that in the 1960s, a couple of matches between Mick McManus and Jackie Pallo, which were put on before the FA Cup final, the biggest sporting event of the British year, drew more viewers than the football -- eleven or twelve million. That's more than one fifth of the population. Even the Queen and Prince Philip were fans. Everyone went to the wrestling at their local town hall or swimming baths; it was a British tradition. And I loved it more than anybody. </p><p> When I turned fifteen I started taking the bus into Wolverhampton on my own to go to the wrestling. By this time I had new heroes: Dave \"Fit\" Finlay and Mark \"Rollerball\" Rocco. But what I liked most were the villains. It was the way they could control people. It was only natural that I'd end up playing a villain myself. In life as well as wrestling, I've always admired the rogues. </p><p> Soon my wrestling education expanded as I travelled further afield to watch my heroes. I'd go to Rhyl town hall in North Wales, where the promoter Oric Williams used to put on shows. Here were all these other guys, ones you never used to see on TV. The independent scene, I suppose you'd call it now -- shows put on by Oric and Brian Dixon. </p><p> Oric used to have all these monsters. One guy was called the Wild Man of Borneo. He was a Sikh who used to come out with all his long hair down and hair all over his body. You'd see people like Crusher Mason and Adrian Street, very different from the guys you saw on TV. Giants like Klondyke Bill and Klondyke Jake. And after I'd seen a few of these shows I was even more enthralled. I loved all the over-the-top stuff. The crazy gimmicks and the face-pulling. </p><p> It wasn't long before I realized there was a great deal more to this wrestling caper than what you saw on Saturday afternoons on <i>World of Sport</i>. Some were just entertainers. Others were very skilled wrestlers. But the ones who were both, who had the whole package, were the ones to emulate. I began to watch the wrestlers who made me believe that what they were doing in the ring was real. As far as that goes, England has the best wrestlers in the world -- or did in those days, at any rate. I was determined to learn that really serious style. I wanted to be a wrestler whose matches were completely believable. </p><p> </p><p> Looking back, I was lucky to be trying to break in when I did. In the late 1970s and early 1980s there were so many amazing guys in Britain to watch and learn from. There was Rocco, Finlay and Marty Jones - someone who became a big influence in my career later on. There was Satoru Sayama who wrestled as Sammy Lee and later became the original Tiger Mask in Japan, and sometimes the Dynamite Kid. </p><p> These people revolutionized the wrestling business in England. They had a style that no one else could do. They wrestled really well. They did flying moves but it was all part of a believable, hard-hitting style -- my favourite. I recently watched a video of Marty Jones wrestling Rocco in 1977 and it still stands up today. It was the first time they ever wrestled each other on TV and you wouldn't know it wasn't a modern match -- in fact, it was better than a lot of what you see today. Incredible wrestling. </p><p> But wrestling isn't the easiest thing in the world to get into. You can't just look in the Situations Vacant column and answer the ad that says \"Wrestlers wanted\". There weren't any textbooks telling you how to get into the business. You had to work it out for yourself. </p><p> My uncle Eddie provided my way in. He used to drink in a pub in Wolverhampton with a guy who did a lot of wrestling. He did local shows, carnivals, that kind of thing. So I met this fellow and started putting up the ring with him -- the traditional first job for anyone starting out in the business. </p><p> On Tuesday afternoons I would go to Wolverhampton Civic Hall and hang around. I'd watch while they put up the ring and after a while I began to meet a few people involved in the shows. I hung around with them and whenever there was an opportunity, I'd get in the ring and I'd try out different things. I'd done a little bit of judo when I was younger, just enough to know how to fall properly. I didn't know anything else, so I started to figure things out for myself. </p><p> There weren't any wrestling clubs in Wolverhampton, so I went to a boxing club to get fit. As a schoolboy I was a fat kid -- when I was ten I weighed ten-and-a-half stone (147 pounds). But I started getting into shape at the boxing club, and all because I wanted to make it as a wrestler. I was determined to find a way in somehow. </p><p> Watching these guys in Wolverhampton, I'd figured out all these falls. So I started practising them at home in my dad's back garden. I made a frame of two-by-two wood, put two eight-by-four sheets of plywood on top and a blanket on top of that to make my own improvised ring and I used to throw myself around on that all the time, trying to teach myself how to fall. I'd backdrop myself off walls onto the grass and fly all over the place. </p><p> All of this was with just one goal in mind. My dad would encourage me, but I'm sure he thought it was just a passing phase, not something to which I'd stay committed. </p><p> Soon I started to get quite tall. Most people today don't realize I'm 6 feet 4 inches. As a villain, I crouch down to look smaller than I am. I want the fans to think they can beat me themselves because they'll hate me all the more when I get away with some in-ring villainy. It's one of the tricks I've picked up along the way. </p><p> So I was tall enough to be a wrestler, but there was a problem: I had no athletic ability whatsoever. I'd never done any sports, watched any or cared about them, for that matter. At school I'd get out of them any way I could. So pretty early on I recognized I couldn't be a high-flying wrestler, even if it was my favourite style to watch. I just didn't have the ability for it. When I tried to fly I looked like a very sad sack indeed. I'd never be a performer like Rocco in the past or Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit today. </p><p> That's why I decided I had to concentrate on mat wrestling and entertaining. Making my matches look more believable and fluid became my obsession. </p><p> </p><p> Before we go any further I think I should explain a few things. I have a tremendous respect for the wrestling business. It has given me every material possession that I own, allowed me to feed my family and taken me around the world. But I owe it to you to tell the truth and that means telling you things about my chosen occupation that I wouldn't have told you ten years ago. </p><p> When I started in the wrestling business it was part of our job to defend the legitimacy of our sport. Nowadays it's very different. In the 1990s, World Wrestling Federation acknowledged that wrestling was entertainment. Nothing that most people didn't already know or at least suspect. Today, people watch wrestling and enjoy it for what it is. They don't feel as though they are having their intelligence insulted. But I personally do not like to overexpose the business -- more on that later. </p><p> Throughout this book I will write honestly about my life and the business I am in. I will be explaining certain aspects of what goes on behind the scenes. So I will start by telling you this -- yes, a professional wrestling match is \"fixed\". But it is not fake. It's fixed because the participants know what the outcome of the match is going to be when they start. It is not fake because the action you see is genuine -- it really does hurt. We are skilful but we are not magicians. No matter what you do, when a man weighing 300 pounds lands on you from a great height, it is going to hurt. </p><p> People say we know how to fall, meaning we can fall in a controlled way. Yes we can -- but in a wrestling match, with so many things going on at the same time and so many switches of momentum, too many things are outside your control. You can't help but fall in an uncontrolled way. That's why there will be so many injuries discussed in this book. </p><p> </p><p> Not only was I dead set on becoming a wrestler, I was dead set on being a wrestler in Blackpool. It wasn't that far away from Staffordshire and when I was a little kid we used to go there for days out. Even then I used to say I would live there one day, because it was like wonderland to me. </p><p> Blackpool is the biggest holiday resort in Europe and, I believe, the second most-visited destination after the Vatican. There's nothing cultural about the place. It promises cheap and cheerful entertainment for the masses. It boasts a giant amusement park, known as the Pleasure Beach -- one of the biggest in the world. </p><p> It's got three big piers, an enormous sandy beach and non-stop entertainment. There's a huge stretch called the Golden Mile -- actually seven miles long -- which is lit up in the winter by the famous Blackpool Illuminations. There's so much to do there -- everything a kid would want. Circuses, amusement parks, arcades full of games and machines. It was a magical place for me when I first set eyes on it and it still is. A lot of people say it's past its heyday now but I don't see that. When I go back there, I still see it as a fairytale place. </p><p> Unsurprisingly, one of my first memories of Blackpool revolves around wrestling. We went to the Pleasure Beach one day when I was nine or ten. We walked round the corner of the beautiful old White Tower building there to be confronted by this row of wrestlers. They looked like monsters to a little lad like me. There was a Red Indian, a Viking, a few masked men and some women. They were throwing out challenges to the crowd, daring them to step in the ring. </p><p> Years later I'd get to know the truth behind some of these people. Radnor the Viking, for example, was a fellow called Dave from Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. I wrestled him later on. But as a youngster, this was the most impressive sight I'd ever experienced. Scary too. When they were challenging the crowd to a fight, I was convinced they were challenging my dad. As far as I was concerned, my dad was the biggest, strongest fellow in the world; but Radnor the Viking was enormous and had a big axe! </p><p> The moment we went in to watch their show, I was hooked. I looked at those men in that ring, with the crowd in the palms of their hands and thought: \"I'm going to work here one day. I'm going to be a wrestler at Blackpool Pleasure Beach.\" </p><p> And a few years later, I was. </p><p> </p><p> I remembered that first view of Radnor the Viking when I was fifteen and went back to the Pleasure Beach to see the wrestlers again. Again, the same experience -- I walked round the corner, saw the wrestlers and knew more than ever this was what I wanted to do. So I started out like many people do in the wrestling business -- from then on, while I was still at school, I went to the Pleasure Beach every weekend and hung around. The promoter, Bobby Baron, was a lovely man who really looked after me. After a few weeks of hanging around, I plucked up the courage to tell Bobby what was on my mind. </p><p> <b><blockquote> I went up to him and blurted it out: \"I want to be a wrestler.\" <p> Bobby took out the pipe that was permanently clenched in his teeth and said: </p><p> \"Eee,\" which was how he started all of his sentences. \"Eee, I bet you do, kid.\" </p><p> \"No, I really do,\" I insisted. </p></blockquote></b> </p><p> </p><p> And that led to my first ever match. My opponent was a man called Shaun who later became Colonel Brody. At the time though, he wrestled as a gay character called Magnificent Maurice. He was 6 feet 6 inches, with an impressive handlebar moustache and a big, bald head. Already, in the short time I'd been hanging around the wrestlers, I'd seen him knock several people out. And there was me, a little fifteen-year-old. </p><p> Still, I got in the ring with him. \"I know what this wrestling's all about,\" I thought. All that training in the back garden would stand me in good stead now. I started by throwing some weak, fake punches at him. He just glared at me. Then, BAM! He whacked me on the back of my head and I went down. He picked me up and proceeded to throw me all over the ring. Soon after -- though the match felt plenty long enough to me at the time -- he got me in a single-leg Boston crab and I tapped out. Either he'd thought I was just another wannabe from the crowd or Bobby had told him to slap me around a bit to get rid of me. But throughout the beating, there was skill there too. He could have hurt me badly, but he didn't. He humiliated me instead. </p><p> </p><p> I wasn't going to give up after just one match. I went back the next weekend and I kept going back. Within a few weeks, they took pity on me and took me in. They had a lot of guys who never became real wrestlers but just worked as plants in the crowd, and they thought I could be one of them. When I got the chance to, I'd jump in the ring and roll about, teaching myself some moves. </p><p> The way it worked was this. The wrestlers lined up outside - just as they had when I'd seen them as a nine-year-old -- while Steve Foster from Wigan, the man on the microphone, would get everyone going. Punters were challenged to get in the ring with the wrestlers. The matches were of three three-minute rounds. Challengers would get £10 for every round they lasted, and £100 if they lasted all three or knocked the wrestler out. </p><p> Steve would get on the mic and use the same spiel he always used. \"What we're looking for are fighting men. Anybody who can have a fight. We want boxers, wrestlers, judo men, karate men, poofs, queers, perverts, Len Faircloughs, anybody who can fight.\" </p><p> Now Blackpool's a tough place. There'd be gangs of lads who would have been roaming around, drinking all day, and they'd be up for it. First a smaller guy, one of our plants, would step up to accept the challenge. That would get the crowd going. Then Steve would ask: \"Is there anybody else?\" and a bigger guy would step in. Now the crowd would be on the hook. They'd <i>ooh</i> and <i>aah</i>, thinking the big guy was bound to have a great chance. Then everyone would file in and pay their money to see the matches. </p><p> Sometimes the wrestlers would have to go out and do this routine two or three times to fill the place up before the show started. It was a great place to learn about crowd psychology. When the big fellow got in to have a go, you could tell everyone was thinking: \"Now here's someone who can win.\" </p><p> The wrestlers who took the challenges usually wore masks. There were a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, it made you look more like a monster when you were standing outside and Steve was getting people in. Secondly, if trouble really kicked off in the shows -- which it did -- or if you had to give someone a really good hiding, you could bugger off when the police came because no one knew what you looked like. The crowds used to be so programmed by TV that they'd shout at the challengers to tear the wrestler's masks off. No good advice, like \"Punch his head in!\" or \"Kick him in the balls!\" Just, \"Tear his mask off!\" That always used to make me laugh. </p><p> </p><p> At the end of that summer season, I had to go back to Codsall to finish my last year in school. Now I had had a taste of this intoxicating new world, school managed the impossible and became even drearier than it had been before. I still went to Wolverhampton when I could to hang around and talk to some of the wrestlers. But I was fixated on getting to the Pleasure Beach. And I wasn't going to stay in school one second longer than I had to. </p><p> When I finally took my exams, I just did them and left. Never even looked at the results. My dad has probably got the certificates somewhere but I've never looked at them. It was May 18, 1984. I was a few days past my sixteenth birthday and about to become a professional wrestler. </p><p>Copyright &amp; © 2005 by World Wrestlin Entertainment, Inc.<br /></p>     27754\n",

Speed is very important. Using the practice tests will help you prepare for this. Taking as many of the practice tests as possible, and making sure to time yourself, will help you become accustomed to the time constraints. Repeating this process will help you develop speed in answering the questions because you will become more familiar with the format.<br /><br />First, make sure you know how much time you have to complete each section. Second, read the directions to each section so that you understand it completely. Third, you should become familiar with the three parts of the ELPT. These sections are:<br /><br /><b>\\n  <i>PART A: Listening Comprehension - Rejoinders</i>\\n</b><br />In this section, which makes up 17 percent of the test, your ability to respond to and understand spoken English will be tested. A tape recording of conversations will be played for you. You will then have seven seconds to choose the answer that would best continue the conversation. The questions, the conversations, and the answer choices will not appear in your test booklet. When you take the sample tests, take Part A for Tests 1-4 by using the provided tapes. Students will be given 10 minutes to complete the 14 questions in Part A. To study for this section, turn to the Listening Comprehension Review - Rejoinders.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <i>PART B: Reading Comprehension - Realia</i>\\n</b><br />This section, which makes up 50 percent of the test, will test your ability to understand written English through published material such as signs, advertisements, directions, menus, labels, tickets, and street signs. The items in this section will include a piece of \"realia\" and test the students' ability to understand its content. Students will be given 30 minutes to complete the 42 questions in Part B. To study for this section, turn to the Reading Comprehension Review - Realia.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <i>PART C: Listening Comprehension - Narratives and Dialogues</i>\\n</b><br />This part, which makes up 33 percent of the test, will have several spoken announcements or conversations which the students listen to and then answer questions about the content or main points of what was said on the tape. The students will be given 12 seconds to complete each question. Part C has 28 questions that must be completed in 20 minutes. To study for this section, turn to the Listening Comprehension Review - Narratives and Dialogues.<br /><br /><b>ABOUT THE REVIEW SECTIONS</b><br />Our reviews are written to help you understand the concepts behind the questions which will be asked in the ELPT. They will help you to prepare for the actual test. They contain study tips on how to choose the best answer quickly and accurately. Also, there will be many drills which will help you in studying for the ELPT. You should use the reviews in conjunction with the diagnostic test and its cross-referencing table, which can show you what areas you need to study the most. The three review sections in this book correspond to the test sections of the official ELPT.<br /><br /><b>Listening Comprehension Reviews</b><br />Both Listening Comprehension parts of the ELPT (Rejoinders and Narratives and Dialogues) will be discussed in great detail in this review. It will illustrate for you the different forms of questions that may appear in those parts of the ELPT. Through using this review, you will learn how to listen for key words and phrases. A number of study tips have been included to help you concentrate more effectively and choose the correct answer quickly.<br /><br /><b>Reading Comprehension Review</b><br />This review will describe for you the \"realia\" that will be presented in Part B of the ELPT. The review will help you learn how to understand the content of various signs, menus, directions, etc.<br /><br /><b>STUDYING FOR THE ELPT</b><br />At first glance, the ELPT may appear to be primarily a test of written English. However, the ELPT not only tests your written English ability., but it also tests your ability to understand spoken English. By using the tests contained in this book, you will be able to develop your abilities in both of these areas.<br /><br />It is important for you to discover the time and place that works best for you. Some students may set aside a certain number of hours every morning to study, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other students may study during the day, while waiting on line, or they may even listen to English tapes while doing chores. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. The most important factor to keep in mind is consistency. Work out a study routine and stick to it!<br /><br />You may want to follow a schedule similar to the one presented at the beginning of this book. Depending on how long before the exam you begin to study, you may want to add to this schedule or condense it.<br /><br />Be sure to take the first practice test before you begin studying the reviews in this book. By taking the practice test before studying you will determine your strengths and weaknesses, enabling your studying to be more concise and effective.<br /><br />When you take the practice tests, you should sit down at a quiet table and time yourself. Try to make the conditions as much like a test center as possible by removing all distractions. Afterwards, you should check each answer and thoroughly review the reasoning behind each question that you missed. You should not review too much at one time. Concentrate on each of your problem areas individually, until you feel comfortable with your ability in each of those areas.<br /><br />Write in the margins and spaces of this book when practicing, and write in the test booklet when taking the test. You should use this space to make notes to yourself, especially notes to go back to a certain question. You should also cross out answers that you know are incorrect. Although you can write in your test booklet, make sure you do not write anything on your answer sheet, except to mark the answer you chose.<br /><br />Keep track of your scores! You will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. You may find it very helpful to work with someone else. If possible, you should find a friend or classmate who is also taking the test. You may even find it convenient to ask a native speaker of English to help you practice.<br /><br /><b>ELPT TEST-TAKING TIPS</b><br />You may be unfamiliar with standardized tests such as the ELPT. There are many ways to acquaint yourself with this type of examination. Listed below are points to help you become familiar with the ELPT, some of which may be applied to other standardized tests.<br /><br /><b>How to Beat the Clock</b><br />Become comfortable with the format of the exam. When you are practicing to take the ELPT, pretend that you are under the same time constraints as you would during the test. Stay calm, pace yourself, and pay attention to the clock. Practice these techniques thoroughly. After simulating the test only a few times, you will be better able to sit down for the actual ELPT much more confidently and boost your chances of doing well.<br /><br />Become familiar with the directions. Make sure you understand them before you take the exam, so that you do not waste valuable time on the exam.<br /><br />Know the format for each section before you actually take the test. This will not only save you valuable time, but also ensure that you are familiar enough with the exam to avoid nervousness (and the mistakes that come from being nervous).<br /><br />Work on the easier questions first. Mark the very difficult questions (in the test booklet, not on the answer sheet) and continue. Remember, only correct answers will be counted in your score. You will not be penalized for guessing, so when you have either answered or marked all of the questions, go back and answer any of the difficult questions that you my have skipped. If you find yourself working too long on one question, mark it and go on. Be sure that you are marking your answer in the space that corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet.<br /><br />Know how much time is allowed for each section. Remember that you are racing against the clock. This is why you should not spend too much time on a single question. Budget your time. Every question has the same value, whether it is difficult or easy, so it is important to move on if a question becomes too time consuming. Pace yourself and make sure to check your time periodically to make sure that you are moving at a good rate.<br /><br /><b>Should I Guess?</b><br />If you don't know the answer to a question, guess! Cross out and eliminate answers (in the test booklet) that you know are wrong, and then pick the best answer from the ones that are left. Even if you can't eliminate any answers, guess anyway! Remember that there is no penalty for guessing, and only correct answers are counted. If you guess, you may increase your number of correct answers.<br /><br /><b>The Day of the Test</b><br />On the day of the test, you should wake up early (hopefully after a decent night 's rest) and have a good breakfast. Make sure you dress comfortably, so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the exam. You should plan to arrive at the test site early. By being early, you will spare yourself the anxiety of being late for the test. It will also allow you to collect your thoughts and to relax before taking the exam. <br /><br />Before you leave your home, make sure you have all the necessary information to be admitted into the test site. You should consult your ELPT handbook for exact requirements.<br /><br />Make sure you bring at least two sharpened #2 (or HB) pencils, with erasers, to the exam. The pencils should be medium-soft with black lead. You may want to wear a watch to the test site; however, only ordinary watches will be permitted. Watches with alarms, calculator functions, flashing lights, beeping sounds, etc., will not be allowed in the test site. No food will be allowed into the examination room.<br /><br /><b>During the Test</b><br />When you arrive at the test center, you will be assigned a seat in the examination room by a member of the test site staff. You will not receive a break during the examination. If you need to use the rest room, or if you become ill, you may leave the examination room, but you must first give the test supervisor your identification documents before you leave the room. If you do leave the room, you will not be allowed to make up any lost time.<br /><br />Once you enter the test site, follow all the instructions given by the test supervisor. If you do not, you risk being dismissed from the examination or having your ELPT scores voided (they will not be scored). Your answer sheet will not be scored and your test payment will not be refunded if you try to remove a test booklet, an answer sheet, or any tape from the test center. All the test materials are the property of Educational Testing Service and legal action may be taken against you if you try to take home test materials or copy them in any way. There are also regulations that, if not followed, will void your answer sheet and then your test payment will not be refunded for any reason. Check your ELPT handbook for a list of these regulations.<br /><br />When all of the test materials have been passed out, the test instructor will give you directions for filling out one side of your answer sheet. You must fill out this sheet carefully since this information will be printed on your score report. Fill out your name exactly as it appears on your identification documents, unless otherwise instructed.<br /><br />Remember to write in the margins and spaces of your test booklet, leaving notes for yourself to return to a question, or just to cross out incorrect answers. Make sure you do not write on your answer sheet, except to fill in the oval corresponding to the answer you chose. You will be marking your answers on the side two of your answer sheet. Each numbered row will contain four ovals corresponding to each answer choice for that question. Fill in the oval which corresponds to your answer darkly, completely, and in a neat manner. You can change your answer, but remember to completely erase your old answer. Only one answer should be marked. This is very important, as your answer sheet will be scored by machine and stray lines or unnecessary marks may cause the machine to score your answers incorrectly.<br /><br />Only work on the section of the test which the test instructor has instructed you to work on. You should begin only when instructed to do so, and stop, immediately, when instructed to end. Do not turn to the next section of the test until you are told to do so. When all of the sections have been completed, you should remain seated until all of the test materials have been collected. You will have to wait for your test results to arrive in the mail, which usually takes about one month.<br />     25082\n",

Many suggestions and comments from reviewers and current users have been included to make this edition even more effective. A comprehensive coverage of electronic devices and circuits, including troubleshooting and practical applications, is provided. Chapters 1 through 11 are essentially devoted to discrete devices and circuits, whereas Chapters 12 through 18 primarily cover linear integrated circuits. The majority of chapters include a troubleshooting section, and most chapters have a System Application feature. The use of data sheets provides an important link between theory and the real world. Extensive exercises and problems using Electronics Workbench/Multisim circuit simulations help the student to verify circuit theory and develop troubleshooting and measurement skills. Referenced circuit files in both EWB Version 5 and Multisim are on the CD-ROM packaged with this book.<br /></p> New to This Edition  <p> New Chapter on Communications Circuits. Chapter 17 includes coverage of basic receivers, multipliers, amplitude and frequency modulation, demodulation, mixers, IF and audio amplifiers, and phase-locked loops. </p> <p> Two Chapters Combined. Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 have been combined by eliminating certain topics that have become nonessential or less important in the context of modern linear ICs. </p> <p> Chapters Reordered. Chapters 6 through 9, which cover amplifiers, have been reordered so that the chapter on power amplifiers is now the last in that sequence and includes both BJTs and FETs. </p> <p> Key Terms. A key terms list is now part of the chapter opener. These key terms are highlighted in color and indicated by a margin icon where they appear in the text. Definitions are given at the end of the chapter as well as at the end of the book in a comprehensive glossary. </p> <p> System Applications Feature. The System Applications, which were formerly numbered sections, are now presented as a special feature rather than a section. This approach is more appropriate to the optional nature of these topics. </p> <p> EWB and Multisim Troubleshooting Problems. A set of problems that reference EWB and Multisim files on the CD-ROM have been added to most chapters. Each reference circuit file contains a simulated circuit with an inserted fault. The student must troubleshoot each circuit to determine the faulty component. </p> <p> General Improvements. Numerous topics throughout the book have been revised either by being completely rewritten, expanded, or condensed to improve and clarify the presentation. Devices that have become obsolete have been replaced by newer, similar devices. </p>  Features     New, attractive text design and layout provide visual interest and ease of use.   Full-color format   Two-page chapter openers with a chapter outline, chapter objectives, introduction, list of key terms, and system application preview   An introduction and list of objectives at the beginning of each section within a chapter   Numerous worked examples, each with a related problem that provides a student exercise similar to that illustrated in the example. Answers to related problems are at the end of the chapter.   An EWB/Multisim simulation on the CD-ROM for selected examples   Section Reviews with answers at the end of the chapter   A Troubleshooting section in the majority of chapters   A System Application at the end of most chapters   Chapter Summary, Key Term glossary, Key Formulas, and Self-Test at the end of each chapter. Answers to the self-test are also at the end of the chapter.   Problem set at the end of each chapter divided by chapter sections and organized into basic and advanced categories. Selected problem circuits are available in EWB and Multisim on the CD-ROM. Additional problem categories of troubleshooting, data sheet, and EWB/Multisim Troubleshooting are found in many chapters.   Table of standard resistor values, derivation of selected equations, data sheets, answers to odd-numbered problems, a comprehensive glossary, and the index are at the end of the book.

Each section in a chapter ends with a review consisting of questions that highlight the main concepts presented in the section. This feature is also illustrated in Figure P-2. The answers to the Section Reviews are at the end of the chapter. </p> <p> Worked Examples, Related Problems, and EWB/Multisim Exercise. Numerous worked examples throughout each chapter illustrate and clarify basic concepts or specific procedures. Each example ends with a Related Problem that reinforces or expands on the example by requiring the student to work through a problem similar to the example. Selected examples feature an EWB/Multisim exercise keyed to a file on the CD-ROM which contains the circuit illustrated in the example. A typical example with a Related Problem and an EWB/Multisim exercise is shown in Figure P-3. Answers to Related Problems are at the end of the chapter. </p> <p> Troubleshooting Sections. Many chapters include a troubleshooting section that relates to the topics covered in the chapter and that illustrates troubleshooting procedures and techniques. </p> <p> System Application. System Applications follow the last section in each chapter (except Chapter 1) and are identified by a special photographic logo and colored background design. A practical application of devices or circuits covered in the chapter is presented. The student learns how the specific device or circuit is used and is asked to compare a schematic to a printed circuit board, develop a test procedure, and troubleshoot specific faults. A typical System Application is shown in Figure P-1. The System Applications are optional and skipping any of them does not affect any other coverage. </p> <p> Although they are not intended or designed for use as a laboratory project, most System Applications use realistic graphics for printed circuit boards and instruments. Results for the System Applications are provided in the Instructor's Resource Manual. </p> <p> Chapter End Matter. The following pedagogical features are found at the end of each chapter: </p>    Summary   Key Term glossary   Key Formulas   Self-Test   Basic Problems   Advanced Problems   Data Sheet Problems (selected chapters)   Troubleshooting Problems (most chapters)   EWB/Multisim Troubleshooting Problems (most chapters)   Answers to Section Reviews   Answers to Related Problems for Examples   Answers to Self-Test     Suggestions for Using This Textbook  <p> As mentioned, this book covers discrete devices in Chapters 1 through 11 and integrated circuits in Chapters 12 through 18. </p> <p> Option 1 (two terms). Chapters 1 through 11 can be covered in the first term. Depending on individual preferences and program emphasis, selective coverage may be necessary. For example, you may choose to omit Chapter 11 if the topic of thyristors is covered in a later industrial electronics course. Chapters 12 through 18 can be covered in the second term. Again, selective coverage may be necessary. </p> <p> Option 2 (one term). By omitting certain topics and by maintaining a rigorous schedule, this book can be used in one-term courses. For example, a course covering only discrete devices and circuits would cover Chapters 1 through 11 with, perhaps, some selectivity. </p> <p> Similarly, a course requiring only linear integrated circuit coverage would cover Chapters 12 through 18. Another approach is a very selective coverage of discrete devices and circuits topics followed by a limited coverage of integrated circuits (only op-amps for example). </p>  To the Student  <p> There is an old saying that is very applicable to the study of this textbook as well as many other endeavors in life. It goes like thisDo one thing at a time, do it very well, and then move on. </p> <p> When studying a particular chapter, study one section until you understand it and only then move on to the next one. Read each section and study the related illustrations carefully, think about the material, work through each example step-by-step, work its Related Problem and check the answer, and then answer each question in the section review, checking your answers at the end of the chapter. Don't expect each concept to be crystal clear after a single reading; you may have to read the material two or even three times. Once you believe that you understand the material, review the chapter summary, key formula list, and key term definitions at the end of the chapter. Take the multiple-choice self-test. Finally, work the assigned problems at the end of the chapter. Working through these problems is perhaps the most important way to check and reinforce your comprehension of the chapter. By working problems, you acquire an additional level of insight and understanding that reading or classroom lectures alone do not provide. </p> <p> Generally, you cannot fully understand a concept or procedure by simply watching or listening to someone else. Only hard work and critical thinking will produce the results you expect and deserve. </p>  Milestones in Electronics  <p> Before you begin your study of electronic devices, let's briefly look at some of the important developments that led to the electronics technology we have today. The names of many of the early pioneers in electricity and electromagnetic s still live on in terms of familiar units and quantities. Names such as Ohm, Ampere, Volta, Farad, Henry, Coulomb, Oersted, and Hertz are some of the better known examples with which you are already familiar. More widely known names such as Franklin and Edison are also significant in the history of electricity and electronics because of their tremendous contributions. Biographies of a few important figures in the history of electronics are shown. </p> <p> The Beginning of Electronics. Early experiments with electronics involved electric currents in vacuum tubes. Heinrich Geissler (1814-1879) removed most of the air from a glass tube and found that the tube glowed when there was current through it. Later, Sir William Crookes (1832-1919) found the current in vacuum tubes seemed to consist of particles. Thomas Edison (1847-1931) experimented with carbon filament bulbs with plates and discovered that there was a current from the hot filament to a positively charged plate. He patented the idea but never used it. </p> <p> Other early experimenters measured the properties of the particles that flowed in vacuum tubes. Sir Joseph Thompson (1856-1940) measured properties of these particles, later called electrons. </p> <p> Although wireless telegraphic communication dates back to 1844, electronics is basically a 20th century concept that began with the invention of the vacuum tube amplifier. An early vacuum tube that allowed current in only one direction was constructed by John A. Fleming in 1904. Called the Fleming valve, it was the forerunner of vacuum tube diodes. In 1907, Lee DeForest added a grid to the vacuum tube. The new device, called the audiotron, could amplify a weak signal. By adding the control element, DeForest ushered in the electronics revolution. It was with an improved version of his device that made transcontinental telephone service and radios possible. In 1912, a radio amateur in San Jose, California, was regularly broadcasting music! </p> <p> In 1921, the secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, issued the first license to a broadcast radio station; within two years over 600 licenses were issued. By the end of the 1920s radios were in many homes. A-new type of radio, the superheterodyne radio, invented by Edwin Armstrong, solved problems with high-frequency communication. In 1923, Vladimir Zworykin, an American researcher, invented the first television picture tube, and in 1927 Philo T. Farnsworth applied for a patent for a complete television system. </p> <p> The 1930s saw many developments in radio, including metal tubes, automatic gain control, \"midget sets,\" directional antennas, and more. Also started in this decade was the development of the first electronic computers. Modern computers trace their origins to the work of John Atanasoff at Iowa State University. Beginning in 1937, he envisioned a binary machine that could do complex mathematical work. By 1939, he and graduate student Clifford Berry had constructed a binary machine called ABC, (for Atanasoff-Berry Computer) that used vacuum tubes for logic and condensers (capacitors) for memory. In 1939, the magnetron, a microwave oscillator, was invented in Britain by Henry Boot and John Randall. In the same year, the klystron microwave tube was invented in America by Russell and Sigurd Varian. </p> <p> During World War II, electronics developed rapidly. Radar and very high-frequency communication were made possible by the magnetron and klystron. Cathode ray tubes were improved for use in radar. Computer work continued during the war. By 1946, John von Neumann had developed the first stored program computer, the Eniac, at the University of Pennsylvania. The decade ended with one of the most important inventions ever, the transistor. </p> <p> Solid-State Electronics. The crystal detectors used in early radios were the forerunners of modern solid-state devices. However, the era of solid-state electronics began with the invention of the transistor in 1947 at Bell Labs. The inventors were Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, and William Shockley. PC (printed circuit) boards were introduced in 1947, the year the transistor was invented. Commercial manufacturing of transistors began in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 1951. </p> <p> The most important invention of the 1950s was the integrated circuit. On September 12, 1958, Jack Kilby, at Texas Instruments, made the first integrated circuit (Figure P-5), for which he was awarded a Nobel prize in the fall of 2000. This invention literally created the modern computer age and brought about sweeping changes in medicine, communication, manufacturing, and the entertainment industry. Many billions of \"chips\"as integrated circuits came to be calledhave since been manufactured. </p> <p> The 1960s saw the space race begin and spurred work on miniaturization and computers. The space race was the driving force behind the rapid changes in electronics that followed. The first successful \"op-amp\" was designed by Bob Widlar at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1965. Called the /AA709, it was very successful but suffered from \"latch-up\" and other problems. Later, the most popular op-amp ever, the 741, was taking shape at Fairchild. This op-amp became the industry standard and influenced design of op-amps for years to come. Precursors to the Internet began in the 1960s with remote networked computers. Systems were in place within Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that connected over 100 terminals to a computer system (colorfully called the \"Octopus system\"). In an experiment in 1969 with very remote computers, an exchange took place between researchers at UCLA and Stanford. The UCLA group hoped to connect to a Stanford computer and began by typing the word \"login\" on its terminal. A separate telephone connection was set up and the following conversation occurred. </p> <p> The UCLA group asked over the phone, \"Do you see the letter L?\" </p> <p> \"Yes, we see the L.\" </p> <p> The UCLA group typed an O. \"Do you see the letter O?\" </p> <p> \"Yes, we see the O.\" </p> <p> The UCLA group typed a G. At this point the system crashed. Such was technology, but a revolution was in the making. </p> <p> By 1971, a new company that had been formed by a group from Fairchild introduced the first microprocessor. The company was Intel and the product was the 4004 chip, which had the same processing power as the Eniac computer. Later in that same year, Intel announced the first 8-bit processor, the 8008. In 1975, the first personal computer was introduced by Altair, and Popular Science magazine featured it on the cover of the January, 1975, issue. The 1970s also saw the introduction of the pocket calculator and new developments in optical integrated circuits. </p> <p> By the 1980s, half of all U.S. homes were using cable hookups instead of television antennas. The reliability, speed, and miniaturization of electronics continued throughout the 1980s, including automated testing and calibrating of PC boards. The computer became a part of instrumentation and the virtual instrument was created. Computers became a standard tool on the workbench. </p> <p> The 1990s saw a widespread application of the Internet. In 1993, there were 130 websites; by the start of the new century (in 2001) there were over 24 million. In the 1990s, companies scrambled to establish a home page and many of the early developments of radio broadcasting had parallels with the Internet. The exchange of information and e-commerce fueled the tremendous economic growth of the 1900s. The Internet became especially important to scientists and engineers, becoming one of the most important scientific communication tools ever. </p> <p> In 1995, the FCC allocated spectrum space for a new service called Digital Audio Radio Service. Digital television standards were adopted in 1996 by the FCC for the nation's next generation of broadcast television. As the 20th century drew toward a close, historians could only breathe a sign of relief. As one wag put it, \"I'm all for new technologies, but I wish they'd let the old ones wear out first\" </p> <p> The 21st century dawned in January 2001 (although most people celebrated the new century the previous year, known as \"Y2K\"). The major technology story was the continued explosive growth of the Internet. Traffic on the Internet doubles every 100 days with no end in sight. The future of technology looks brighter than ever. </p>  Acknowledgments  Many capable people have been part of this revision for the sixth edition of Electronic Devices.

TEST<i>ware</i></u>\\n</b><br /><br />This book provides you with an accurate and complete representation of the Florida Teacher Certification Examination (FTCE) Professional Education Test. Inside you will find topical reviews designed to equip you with the information and strategies needed to pass the exam. REA also gives you two full-length practice tests, which are based on the most recently administered FTCE and contain every type of question that you can expect to encounter on test day. As with the actual test, each of ours takes two and one-half hours to complete. Following each practice test, you will find an answer key with detailed explanations designed to help you better grasp the test material.<br /><br />The Practice tests in this book and software package are included in two formats; they are printed in the book and offered as TEST<i>ware </i>on the enclosed CD. <b>We recommend that you begin your preparation by first taking the practice exams on your computer. </b>The software provides timed conditions, automatic scoring, and scoring information, all of which makes it easier to pinpoint your strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>About the Test</u>\\n</b><br /><br /><b>Who takes the test and what is it used for?</b><br />The FTCE is taken by individuals seeking initial teacher certification in Florida. Educators must pass the Professional Education Test as one of the requirements for their first five-year Florida Professional Certificate. You are eligible to take the test if you meet any one of these criteria:<br />- Enrolled in a college or university teacher-preparation program<br />- Teaching with provisional certification<br />- Making a teaching career change to public school teaching<br /><br />If you do not do well on the FTCE, don't panic! The test can be taken again, so you can work on improving your score in preparation for your next FTCE. A score on the FTCE that does not match your expectations does not mean you should change your plans about teaching.<br /><br /><b>Who administers the test?</b><br />The FTCE is developed and administered by the Florida Department of Education. A test development process was designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate.<br /><br /><b>When should the FTCE be taken?</b><br />The test should be taken just before or right after graduation for those seeking certification right out of school. While the FTCE is required to teach in Florida, you may be issued a two-year temporary certificate while completing your teaching requirements and working toward passing the FTCE itself.<br /><br />The FTCE is usually administered four times a year in several locations throughout Florida. The usual testing day is Saturday but the test may be taken on an alternate day if a conflict, such as a religious obligation, exists. Special accommodations can also be made for applicants who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically disabled, or specific learning disabled.<br />To receive information on upcoming administrations of the FTCE, consult the FTCE Registration Bulletin, which can be obtained by contacting:<br /><br />FTCE Inquiries<br />Florida Department of Education<br />325 West Gaines Street, Suite 414<br />Tallahassee, FL 32399-0400<br />Phone: (850) 488-8198 or (813) 974-2400<br />Website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.firn.edu/doe/sas/ftcehome.htm\">http://www.firn.edu/doe/sas/ftcehome.htm</a><br /> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cefe.usf.edu/requestapp.aspx\">http://www.cefe.usf.edu/requestapp.aspx</a><br /><br />The FTCE Registration Bulletin also includes information regarding test retakes and score reports. <br /><br /><b>Is there a registration fee?</b><br />To take the FTCE, you must pay a registration fee. You may pay by personal check, money order, cashier's check, or Visa or MasterCard. Cash is not accepted.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>How to Use this Book</u>\\n</b><br /><br /><b>What do I study first?</b><br />Read over the reviews and the suggestions for test-taking. Studying the reviews thoroughly will reinforce the basic skills you will need to do well on the exam. Make sure to take the practice tests to become familiar with the format and procedures involved with taking the actual FTCE.<br />To best utilize your study time, follow our FTCE Independent Study Schedule located at the end of this chapter. The schedule is based on a seven-week program, but can be condensed to four weeks if necessary.<br /><br /><b>When should I start studying?</b><br />It is never too early to start studying for the FTCE. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the test material.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>Format of the FTCE</u>\\n</b><br /><br />The Professional Education Test features 120 questions designed to assess your knowledge of the information described in the competencies included in our review sections.<br /><br />The test covers the 14 teaching competencies identified by the Florida Department of Education as foundational to effective teaching. Mastery of the content included in each of the competencies is gauged by one or more items on the examination. Individual test items require a variety of different thinking levels, ranging from simple recall to evaluation and problem solving.<br /><br />The competencies are broad statements written in a way that reflect the information an entry-level educator needs in order to be a truly effective teacher. Within the review section, each competency is broken down into the competency statement and a description of what the competency covers. The competencies will not be discussed in the actual FTCE test.<br /><br />All the questions on the FTCE are in multiple-choice format. Each question will have four options, lettered A through D, from which to choose. You should have plenty of time in which to complete the FTCE, but be aware of the amount of time you are spending on each question so that you allow yourself time to complete the test. Although speed is not very important, a steady pace should be maintained when answering the questions. Using the practice tests will help you prepare for this task.<br /><br /><b>Computer-Based Testing</b><br />A computer-based test is also available. To register, visit <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cefe.usf.edu\">http://www.cefe.usf.edu</a> and click on \"Computer-Based Testing.\" If you decide to take the exam on the computer, you will receive notice of Pass/Fail immediately after completing the exam. It can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.<br /><br /><b>About the Review Sections</b><br />The reviews in this book are designed to help you sharpen the basic skills needed to approach the FTCE, as well as provide strategies for attacking the questions.<br /><br />Each teaching competency is examined in a separate chapter. All 14 competencies are extensively discussed to sharpen your understanding of what the FTCE covers.<br /><br />Your schooling has taught you most of what you need to answer the questions on the test. The education classes you took should have provided you with the know-how to make important decisions about situations you will face as a teacher. Our review is designed to help you fit the information you have acquired into specific competency components. Reviewing your class notes and textbooks together with our competency reviews will give you an excellent springboard for passing the FTCE.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>Scoring the FTCE</u>\\n</b><br /><br /><b>How do I score my practice test?</b><br />There are a total of 120 questions on the FTCE Professional Education Test. A score of 200 or higher, which is equivalent to 56% correct, is needed to pass. In other words, you need to answer approximately 67 questions correctly to achieve a passing score.<br /><br />If you do not achieve a passing score, review the detailed explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly. Note which types of questions you answered wrong, and re-examine the corresponding review. After further review, you may want to retake the practice tests.<br /><br /><b>When will I receive my score report and what will it look like?</b><br />Approximately one month after you take the test, your score report will be mailed to you. You will receive two original score reports and are responsible for sending one to the Bureau of Teacher Certification. A copy of your score report is provided to one Florida college or university and one Florida school district. You should have requested this information on your registration application.<br /><br />When you receive your score report and have passed with a 200 or higher, only the word PASS will be reported. If you do not pass, you will receive a numeric score and will have to retake the test.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>Studying for the FTCE</u>\\n</b><br /><br />It is very important for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some individuals may set aside a certain number of hours every morning to study, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other people may study during the day, while waiting on line, or even while eating lunch. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. Be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a study routine and stick to it.<br /><br />When you take the practice tests, simulate the conditions of the actual test as closely as possible. Turn your television and radio off, and sit down at a quiet table free from distraction.<br />As you complete each practice test, score your test and thoroughly review the explanations to the questions you answered incorrectly; however, do not review too much at any one time. Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review until you are confident that you have mastered the material.<br /><br />Keep track of your scores. By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. Give extra attention to the reviews that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas.<br /><br /><b>Test-Taking Tips</b><br /><br />Although you may not be familiar with tests like the FTCE, this book will help acquaint you with this type of exam and help alleviate your test-taking anxieties. Listed below are ways to help you become accustomed to the FTCE, some of which may be applied to other tests as well.<br /><br />Become comfortable with the format of the FTCE. When you are practicing, simulate the conditions under which you will be taking the actual test. Stay calm and pace yourself. After simulating the test only once, you will boost your chances of doing well, and you will be able to sit down for the actual FTCE with much more confidence.<br /><br />Read all of the possible answers. Just because you think you have found the correct response, do not automatically assume that it is the best answer. Read through each choice to be sure that you are not making a mistake by jumping to conclusions.<br /><br />Use the process of elimination. Go through each answer to a question and eliminate as many of the answer choices as possible. By eliminating two answer choices, you have given yourself a better chance of getting the item correct since there will only be two choices left from which to make your guess. Do not leave an answer blank; it is better to guess than to not answer a question on the FTCE test.<br /><br />Work quickly and steadily. You will have two and one-half hours to complete the test, so work quickly and steadily to avoid focusing on any one problem too long. Taking the practice tests in this book will help you learn to budget your precious time.<br /><br />Learn the directions and format of the test. Familiarizing yourself with the directions and format of the test will not only save time, but will also help you avoid anxiety (and the mistakes caused by getting anxious).<br /><br />Be sure that the answer circle you are marking corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet. Since the test is multiple-choice, it is graded by machine, and marking one wrong answer can throw off your answer key and your score. Be extremely careful.<br /><br /><b>\\n  <u>The Day of the Test </u>\\n</b><br /><br /><b>Before the Test</b><br />On the day of the test, make sure to dress comfortably, so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the test. Plan to arrive at the test center early. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and relax before the test, and will also spare you the anguish that comes with being late.<br /><br />You should check your FTCE Registration Bulletin to find out what time to arrive at the testing center.<br /><br />Before you leave for the test center, make sure that you have your admission ticket and two forms of identification, one of which must contain a recent photograph, your name, and signature (i.e., driver's license). You will not be admitted to the test center if you do not have proper identification.<br /><br />You must bring several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, as none will be provided at the test center.<br /><br />If you would like, you may wear a watch to the test center. However, you may not wear one that makes noise, because it may disturb the other test takers. Dictionaries, textbooks, notebooks, calculators, briefcases, or packages will not be permitted. Drinking, smoking, and eating are prohibited.<br /><br /><b>During the Test</b><br />The FTCE is given in one sitting with no breaks. Procedures will be followed to maintain test security. Once you enter the test center, follow all of the rules and instructions given by the test supervisor. If you do not, you risk being dismissed from the test and having your scores cancelled.<br /><br />When all of the materials have been distributed, the test instructor will give you directions for filling out your answer sheet. Fill out this sheet carefully since this information will be printed on your score report.<br /><br />Once the test begins, mark only one answer per question, completely erase unwanted answers and marks, and fill in answers darkly and neatly.<br /><br /><b>After the Test</b><br />When you finish your test, hand in your materials and you will be dismissed. Then, go home and relax - you deserve it!<br />     24155\n",

The program consists of two components: an AP course and an AP exam. In addition, the AP in Government and Politics curriculum is divided into two courses: United States Government &amp; Politics and Comparative Government &amp; Politics.<br /><br />If you wish to pursue an Advanced Placement in Government and Politics course you may enroll in the United States course, the Comparative course, or both. You will be expected to leave the course(s) with college-level writing skills and knowledge of government and politics. Upon completion of the course(s), you may then take the corresponding AP exam(s). Test results are then used to grant course credit and/or determine placement level in the subject when you enter college.<br /><br />AP exams are administered every May. The exam schedule has been designed to allow you the opportunity to take both exams, if you are enrolled in both courses. If the United States exam is given during the morning administration, the Comparative exam will be given during the afternoon administration.<br /><br /><b>The AP United States Government &amp; Politics Exam</b><br />The United States exam is 145 minutes in length and is divided into two sections:<br /><br /><b>I. Multiple-Choice (50% of your grade):</b> This 45-minute section is composed of 60 questions designed to measure your understanding of facts, concepts, and theories pertinent to United States government and politics. Your ability to analyze and understand data, and the patterns and consequences involved with political processes and behaviors will also be tested. In addition you must have knowledge of the various institutions, groups, beliefs, and ideas relevant to United States government and politics.<br /><br /><b>II. Free-Response (50% of your grade): </b>This 100-minute section consists of four mandatory questions, each of which accounts for one-fourth of your total free-response score. You should allot roughly 25 minutes - or one-quarter of the total time in the free-response segment - for each essay. Each question normally asks you to interrelate ideas from different content areas from among the topics listed below. In addition, you may also be asked to evaluate and define fundamental concepts in the study of United States politics, and possibly to analyze case studies that bear on political relationships and events in the United States. You will be required to demonstrate mastery of political interpretation, and analytic and organizational skills through writing. In addition, you may be presented with graphs, charts and tables from whose data you would be asked to draw logical conclusions.<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of coverage on the United States exam:<br /><br /><b>Topics / % of Exam </b><br />I. Constitutional Underpinnings of United States Government / 5-15%<br />II. Political Beliefs and Behaviors / 10-20%<br />III. Political Parties, Interest Groups, and Mass Media / 10-20%<br />IV. Institutions of National Government: The Congress, the Presidency, the Bureaucracy, and the Federal Courts / 35-45%<br />V. Public Policy / 5-15%<br />VI. Civil Rights and Civil Liberties / 5-15%<br /><br /><b>The AP Comparative Government &amp; Politics Exam</b><br />The Comparative exam is 145 minutes long and is divided into two sections:<br /><br /><b>I. Multiple-Choice (50% of your grade): </b>This 45-minute section is composed of 60 questions designed to measure your understanding of facts, concepts, and theories pertinent to Comparative government and politics. Your ability to analyze and understand data, and the patterns and consequences involved with political processes and behaviors will also be tested. The countries normally tested in the multiple-choice questions include Great Britain, France, the former Soviet Union (Commonwealth of Independent States), and China; these are referred to as the core countries tested on the exam. For certain questions, basic knowledge of the United States will be assumed.<br /><br /><b>II. Free-Response (50% of your grade): </b>This 100-minute section consists of four mandatory questions, each of which accounts for one-fourth of your total free-response score. You should allot roughly 25 minutes - or one-quarter of the total time in the free-response segment - for each essay. Comparative Free-Response questions may require you to compare one or two of the core countries (Great Britain, France, China, and the former Soviet Union) with the developing nations of either India, Mexico, or Nigeria. To do this, you must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the politics of one of these developing nations. <br /><br />Here's a breakdown of coverage on the Comparative exam:<br /><br /><b>Topics / % of Exam </b><br />I. The Sources of Public Authority and Political Power / 5-15%<br />II. Society and Politics / 5-15%<br />III. The Relationship Between Citizen and State / 5-15%<br />IV. Political and Institutional Frameworks / 35-45%<br />V. Political Change / 15-25%<br />VI. The Comparative Method / 5-10%<br /><br /><b>About the Review Sections</b><br />As mentioned earlier, this book includes two reviews: one for United States Government and Politics, the other for Comparative Government and Politics.<br /><br />The United States Government and Politics Review covers all of the key information you'll need to score well on the United States exam. These topics include:<br /><br />- Constitutional Framework<br />- The Federal Government<br />- Political Institutions and Special Interests<br />- Public Opinion and Voter Behavior<br />- Civil Rights and the Supreme Court<br /><br />We also provide a glossary for the United States Government and Politics exam. Included are the key historical figures, court cases, programs, laws, etc., that often appear on this AP exam.<br /><br />The Comparative Review provides a thorough discussion of the material most often tested on the Comparative exam. Special emphasis is placed on the governments and politics of:<br /><br />- Britain<br />- France<br />- The former Soviet Union<br />- The People's Republic of China<br /><br />A glossary for the Comparative Government and Politics exam enables you to brush up on terms that you are likely to encounter on this test.<br /><br /><b>Scoring the Exam</b><br />After the AP administrations, more than 1,700 college professors and secondary school teachers are brought together to grade the exams during the first two weeks of June. These readers are chosen from around the United States for their familiarity with the AP program. <br /><br />The Multiple-Choice sections of the Comparative Government &amp; Politics and U.S. Government &amp; Politics exams are scored by granting one point for each correct answer and deducting one-fourth of a point for each incorrect answer. Unanswered questions receive neither credit nor deduction. <br /><br />The Free-Response answers are read and scored using a specific set of objective criteria, but the actual points available for each question may vary from administration to administration. For purposes of this discussion - and REA's practice tests - the Comparative exam questions will yield a score between 0 and 9 (with 0 being the lowest and 9 the highest) on Free-Response Part I, and a score of between 0 and 5 (with 0 being the lowest and 5 the highest) on Free-Response Part II. All four Free-Response items on our U.S. Government practice exam are scored on the 0-to-9 scale. Once the responses are graded, the scores can be converted. <br /><br />The AP Government and Politics exam is based on a 120-point scale. The breakdown of the percentages and points is as follows (note that the available free-response points will vary):<br /><br />Once raw scores have been obtained for each section, they are weighted to produce a composite score. Then the composite scores for each section are added together to form a total composite score for the exam. The range for the composite score is from 0 to 120.<br /><br />Finally, the composite score is translated into a range of from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.<br /><br /><b>Scoring the Multiple-Choice Section</b><br />Use this formula to calculate your raw score for the multiple-choice section:<br /><br />(# right answers) - (# wrong x 1/4) = raw score <i>round off to nearest whole number; if the number is less than zero, enter zero</i><br /><br /><b>Scoring the Free-Response Section</b><br />The following guide explains typical free-response scoring criteria:<br /><br /><u>Score Explanation of Score</u><br />8-9 The thesis is extremely well developed and is supported with concrete evidence; all aspects of the question have been addressed thoroughly; discussions presented are balanced.<br />6-7 The thesis is defined and supported; the evidence provided is very organized; the essay may be slightly imbalanced with one strong argument and one weak argument and/or discuss one topic more thoroughly than the next; sporadic factual errors may appear.<br />5 A basic argument or thesis is provided; evidence given supports the argument or thesis, but does not clearly connect with the argument or thesis; only the formal facets of the question are dealt with, and informal facets are not adequately covered; not all aspects of the question are discussed.<br />4 The thesis is not organized and is not referred to in the essay; the essay is little more than a recounting of facts and events; the essay may be overloaded with data; only one facet of the questions may be discussed; numerous factual errors may appear.<br />3 The thesis is weak; evidence provided in support does not apply to the thesis; factual errors are apparent.<br />2 The thesis is very weak; little or no factual evidence is provided to support the thesis; irrelevant and inaccurate information appears.<br />1 An attempt is made to answer the question, but the support given is insignificant and the coverage of topics is incomplete.<br />0 The question is not answered with any significance.<br /><br /><b>Free-Response Part II (Comparative only)</b><br /><br /><u>Score Explanation of Score</u> <br />5 The thesis is extremely well developed and is supported with concrete evidence; all aspects of the question have been addressed thoroughly; discussions are presented in a balanced way.<br />4 The thesis is defined and supported; the evidence provided is very organized; the essay may be slightly imbalanced, with one strong argument and one weak argument; likewise, one topic may be more thoroughly explored than another; may be marred by sporadic factual errors.<br />3 A basic argument or thesis is presented; evidence given supports the argument or thesis, but does not clearly connect with the argument or thesis; only the formal facets of the question are dealt with, and informal facets are not adequately covered; not all aspects of the question are discussed.<br />2 The thesis is weak; evidence provided in support does not apply to the thesis; factual errors are apparent.<br />1 An attempt is made to answer the question, but the support given is insignificant and the coverage of topics is incomplete.<br />0 The question is not answered with any significance.<br /><br />It would be extremely helpful to find someone who is willing to score your essay - your teachers or anyone who is familiar with the test material. If you do, ask the person to assign each of your U.S. and Comparative (Part I) essays a score of 0 to 9. For your Comparative (Part II) essays, use the 0-to-5 scale.<br /><br />If you must grade your own essays, try to be objective! In addition, you may want to give your essays three different grades. For instance, if you feel you did well, try giving the essay a score of 5, 6, or 7 to represent the various scores you may receive. By underestimating what your score may be, you are more likely to receive a better score on the actual exam.<br />Use the following formulae to determine your raw score for the Free-Response section:<br /><br /><u>United States Exam (Free-Response)</u><br />Response (1) score x 1.66 = raw score<br />Response (2) score x 1.66 = raw score<br />Response (3) score x 1.66 = raw score<br />Response (4) score x 1.66 = raw score<br /><br /><u>Comparative Exam</u><br />Response (1) score x 1.66 = raw score<br />Response (2) score x 1.66 = raw score<br />Response (3) score x 3 = raw score<br />Response (4) score x 3 = raw score<br /><br /><u>The Composite Score</u><br />Once you have obtained your raw scores for both the Multiple-Choice and the Free-Response sections, add the scores together to get your composite score:<br /><br /><u>United States Exam</u><br />Multiple-Choice raw score + Free-Response raw score = composite score (round to nearest whole number)<br /><br />Score Essay 1 + Score Essay 2 + Score Essay 3 + Score Essay 4 = raw score<br /><br /><u>Comparative Exam</u><br />Multiple-Choice raw score + Free-Response raw score = composite score (round to nearest whole number)<br /><br />Now compare your composite score with the scale below:<br /><br /><u>Composite Score / AP Grade</u><br />88 - 120 / 5<br />74 - 87 / 4<br />54 - 73 / 3<br />35 - 53 / 2<br />0 - 34 / 1<br /><br />AP grades are interpreted as follows: 5-extremely well qualified, 4-well qualified, 3-qualified, 2-possibly qualified, and 1-no recommendation. <br />Scores that Earn College Credit and/or Advanced Placement<br /><br />Most colleges grant students who earn a 3 or above college credit and/or advanced placement. You should check with your school guidance office about specific college requirements.<br /><br /><b>Studying for Your AP Examination</b><br />It is never too early to start studying. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the test material.<br /><br />It is very important for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some students may set aside a certain number of hours every morning to study, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other students may study during the day, while waiting on a line, or even while eating lunch. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. But, be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a study routine and stick to it!<br /><br />When you take the practice exam(s), try to make your testing conditions as much like the actual test as possible. Turn your television and radio off, and sit down at a quiet table free from distraction. Make sure to time yourself.<br /><br />As you complete the practice test(s), score your test(s) and thoroughly review the explanations to the questions you answered incorrectly, but do not review too much during any one sitting. <br /><br />Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review(s) until you are confident that you completely understand the material.<br /><br />Since you will be allowed to write in your test booklet during the actual exam, you may want to write in the margins and spaces of this book when practicing. However, do not make miscellaneous notes on your answer sheet. Mark your answers clearly and make sure the answer you have chosen corresponds to the question you are answering.<br /><br />Keep track of your scores! By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. You should carefully study the reviews that cover the topics causing you difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas.<br /><br />To get the most out of your studying time, we recommend that you follow the Study Schedule which corresponds to the exam you are taking. It details how you can best budget your time. If you are taking both exams, do not try to study for each at the same time. Try alternating days by studying for the United States exam one day and the Comparative exam the next.<br /><br /><b>Test-Taking Tips</b><br />Although you may be unfamiliar with tests such as the Advanced Placement exams, there are many ways to acquaint yourself with this type of examination and help alleviate your test-taking anxieties. Listed below are ways to help yourself become accustomed to the AP exam, some of which may also be applied to other standardized tests.<br /><br />Become comfortable with the format of the AP Examination in Government and Politics that you are taking. When you are practicing to take the exam(s), simulate the conditions under which you will be taking the actual test(s). You should practice under the same time constraints as well. Stay calm and pace yourself. After simulating the test only a couple of times, you will boost your chances of doing well, and you will be able to sit down for the actual test much more confidently.<br /><br />Know the directions and format for each section of the exam. Familiarizing yourself with the directions and format of the different test sections will not only save you time, but will also ensure that you are familiar enough with the AP exam to avoid nervousness (and the mistakes caused by being nervous).<br /><br />Work on the easier questions first. If you find yourself working too long on one question, make a mark next to it in your test booklet and continue. After you have answered all of the questions that you can, go back to the ones you have skipped.<br /><br />Use the process of elimination when you are unsure of an answer. If you can eliminate three of the answer choices, you have given yourself a fifty-fifty chance of getting the item correct since there will only be two choices left from which to make a guess. If you cannot eliminate at least three of the answer choices, you may choose not to guess, as you will be penalized one-quarter of a point for every incorrect answer. Questions not answered will not be counted.<br /><br />Be sure that you are marking your answer in the circle that corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet. Since the multiple-choice section is graded by machine, marking the wrong answer will throw off your score.<br />     23278\n",

REA also gives you two full-length practice tests, which are based on the most recently administered FTCE and contain every type of question that you can expect to encounter on test day. As with the actual test, each of ours takes two and one-half hours to complete. Following each practice test, you will find an answer key with detailed explanations designed to help you better grasp the test material.<br /><br /><b><u>About the Test</u></b><br /><br /><b>Who takes the test and what is it used for?</b><br />The FTCE is taken by individuals seeking initial teacher certification in Florida. Educators must pass the Professional Education Test as one of the requirements for their first five-year Florida Professional Certificate. You are eligible to take the test if you meet any one of these criteria:<br />- Enrolled in a college or university teacher-preparation program<br />- Teaching with provisional certification<br />- Making a teaching career change to public school teaching<br /><br />If you do not do well on the FTCE, don't panic! The test can be taken again, so you can work on improving your score in preparation for your next FTCE. A score on the FTCE that does not match your expectations does not mean you should change your plans about teaching.<br /><br /><b>Who administers the test?</b><br />The FTCE is developed and administered by the Florida Department of Education. A test development process was designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate.<br /><br /><b>When should the FTCE be taken?</b><br />The test should be taken just before or right after graduation for those seeking certification right out of school. While the FTCE is required to teach in Florida, you may be issued a two-year temporary certificate while completing your teaching requirements and working toward passing the FTCE itself.<br /><br />The FTCE is usually administered four times a year in several locations throughout Florida. The usual testing day is Saturday but the test may be taken on an alternate day if a conflict, such as a religious obligation, exists. Special accommodations can also be made for applicants who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically disabled, or specific learning disabled.<br />To receive information on upcoming administrations of the FTCE, consult the FTCE Registration Bulletin, which can be obtained by contacting:<br /><br />FTCE Inquiries<br />Florida Department of Education<br />325 West Gaines Street, Suite 414<br />Tallahassee, FL 32399-0400<br />Phone: (850) 488-8198 or (813) 974-2400<br />Website: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.firn.edu/doe/sas/ftcehome.htm\">http://www.firn.edu/doe/sas/ftcehome.htm</a><br /> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cefe.usf.edu/requestapp.aspx\">http://www.cefe.usf.edu/requestapp.aspx</a><br /><br />The FTCE Registration Bulletin also includes information regarding test retakes and score reports. <br /><br /><b>Is there a registration fee?</b><br />To take the FTCE, you must pay a registration fee. You may pay by personal check, money order, cashier's check, or Visa or MasterCard. Cash is not accepted.<br /><br /><b><u>How to Use this Book</u></b><br /><br /><b>What do I study first?</b><br />Read over the reviews and the suggestions for test-taking. Studying the reviews thoroughly will reinforce the basic skills you will need to do well on the exam. Make sure to take the practice tests to become familiar with the format and procedures involved with taking the actual FTCE.<br /><br />To best utilize your study time, follow our FTCE Independent Study Schedule located at the end of this chapter. The schedule is based on a seven-week program, but can be condensed to four weeks if necessary.<br /><br /><b>When should I start studying?</b><br />It is never too early to start studying for the FTCE. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is not an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the test material.<br /><br /><b><u>Format of the FTCE</u></b><br /><br />The Professional Education Test features 120 questions designed to assess your knowledge of the information described in the competencies included in our review sections.<br />The test covers the 14 teaching competencies identified by the Florida Department of Education as foundational to effective teaching. Mastery of the content included in each of the competencies is gauged by one or more items on the examination. Individual test items require a variety of different thinking levels, ranging from simple recall to evaluation and problem solving.<br /><br />The competencies are broad statements written in a way that reflect the information an entry-level educator needs in order to be a truly effective teacher. Within the review section, each competency is broken down into the competency statement and a description of what the competency covers. The competencies will not be discussed in the actual FTCE test.<br /><br />All the questions on the FTCE are in multiple-choice format. Each question will have four options, lettered A through D, from which to choose. You should have plenty of time in which to complete the FTCE, but be aware of the amount of time you are spending on each question so that you allow yourself time to complete the test. Although speed is not very important, a steady pace should be maintained when answering the questions. Using the practice tests will help you prepare for this task.<br /><br /><b>Computer-Based Testing</b><br />A computer-based test is also available. To register, visit <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cefe.usf.edu\">http://www.cefe.usf.edu</a> and click on \"Computer-Based Testing.\" If you decide to take the exam on the computer, you will receive notice of Pass/Fail immediately after completing the exam. It can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.<br /><br /><b>About the Review Sections</b><br />The reviews in this book are designed to help you sharpen the basic skills needed to approach the FTCE, as well as provide strategies for attacking the questions.<br /><br />Each teaching competency is examined in a separate chapter. All 14 competencies are extensively discussed to sharpen your understanding of what the FTCE covers.<br /><br />Your schooling has taught you most of what you need to answer the questions on the test. The education classes you took should have provided you with the know-how to make important decisions about situations you will face as a teacher. Our review is designed to help you fit the information you have acquired into specific competency components. Reviewing your class notes and textbooks together with our competency reviews will give you an excellent springboard for passing the FTCE.<br /><br /><b><u>Scoring the FTCE</u></b><br /><br /><b>How do I score my practice test?</b><br />There are a total of 120 questions on the FTCE Professional Education Test. A score of 200 or higher, which is equivalent to 56% correct, is needed to pass. In other words, you need to answer approximately 67 questions correctly to achieve a passing score.<br /><br />If you do not achieve a passing score, review the detailed explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly. Note which types of questions you answered wrong, and re-examine the corresponding review. After further review, you may want to retake the practice tests.<br /><br /><b>When will I receive my score report and what will it look like?</b><br />Approximately one month after you take the test, your score report will be mailed to you. You will receive two original score reports and are responsible for sending one to the Bureau of Teacher Certification. A copy of your score report is provided to one Florida college or university and one Florida school district. You should have requested this information on your registration application.<br /><br />When you receive your score report and have passed with a 200 or higher, only the word PASS will be reported. If you do not pass, you will receive a numeric score and will have to retake the test.<br /><br /><b><u>Studying for the FTCE</u></b><br /><br />It is very important for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some individuals may set aside a certain number of hours every morning to study, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other people may study during the day, while waiting on line, or even while eating lunch. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. Be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a study routine and stick to it.<br /><br />When you take the practice tests, simulate the conditions of the actual test as closely as possible. Turn your television and radio off, and sit down at a quiet table free from distraction.<br />As you complete each practice test, score your test and thoroughly review the explanations to the questions you answered incorrectly; however, do not review too much at any one time. Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review until you are confident that you have mastered the material.<br /><br />Keep track of your scores. By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. Give extra attention to the reviews that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas.<br /><br /><b>Test-Taking Tips</b><br /><br />Although you may not be familiar with tests like the FTCE, this book will help acquaint you with this type of exam and help alleviate your test-taking anxieties. Listed below are ways to help you become accustomed to the FTCE, some of which may be applied to other tests as well.<br /><br />Become comfortable with the format of the FTCE. When you are practicing, simulate the conditions under which you will be taking the actual test. Stay calm and pace yourself. After simulating the test only once, you will boost your chances of doing well, and you will be able to sit down for the actual FTCE with much more confidence.<br /><br />Read all of the possible answers. Just because you think you have found the correct response, do not automatically assume that it is the best answer. Read through each choice to be sure that you are not making a mistake by jumping to conclusions.<br /><br />Use the process of elimination. Go through each answer to a question and eliminate as many of the answer choices as possible. By eliminating two answer choices, you have given yourself a better chance of getting the item correct since there will only be two choices left from which to make your guess. Do not leave an answer blank; it is better to guess than to not answer a question on the FTCE test.<br /><br />Work quickly and steadily. You will have two and one-half hours to complete the test, so work quickly and steadily to avoid focusing on any one problem too long. Taking the practice tests in this book will help you learn to budget your precious time.<br /><br />Learn the directions and format of the test. Familiarizing yourself with the directions and format of the test will not only save time, but will also help you avoid anxiety (and the mistakes caused by getting anxious).<br /><br />Be sure that the answer circle you are marking corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet. Since the test is multiple-choice, it is graded by machine, and marking one wrong answer can throw off your answer key and your score. Be extremely careful.<br /><br /><b><u>The Day of the Test </u></b><br /><br /><b>Before the Test</b><br />On the day of the test, make sure to dress comfortably, so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the test. Plan to arrive at the test center early. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and relax before the test, and will also spare you the anguish that comes with being late.<br /><br />You should check your FTCE Registration Bulletin to find out what time to arrive at the testing center.<br /><br />Before you leave for the test center, make sure that you have your admission ticket and two forms of identification, one of which must contain a recent photograph, your name, and signature (i.e., driver's license). You will not be admitted to the test center if you do not have proper identification.<br /><br />You must bring several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, as none will be provided at the test center.<br /><br />If you would like, you may wear a watch to the test center. However, you may not wear one that makes noise, because it may disturb the other test takers. Dictionaries, textbooks, notebooks, calculators, briefcases, or packages will not be permitted. Drinking, smoking, and eating are prohibited.<br /><br /><b>During the Test</b><br />The FTCE is given in one sitting with no breaks. Procedures will be followed to maintain test security. Once you enter the test center, follow all of the rules and instructions given by the test supervisor. If you do not, you risk being dismissed from the test and having your scores cancelled.<br /><br />When all of the materials have been distributed, the test instructor will give you directions for filling out your answer sheet. Fill out this sheet carefully since this information will be printed on your score report.<br /><br />Once the test begins, mark only one answer per question, completely erase unwanted answers and marks, and fill in answers darkly and neatly.<br /><br /><b>After the Test</b><br />When you finish your test, hand in your materials and you will be dismissed. Then, go home and relax - you deserve it!<br /></div>     22968\n"
